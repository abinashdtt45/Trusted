It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!! I also have used oregano as emergency medicine to completely eliminate digestive distress after eating what I found out was contaminated food.\n",

Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a \"fat burner\" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)\n",

At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!!

      "This company sent me a email after i purchased this on eBay and asked me to review the product on amazon.  They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks.

      "It was so poorly made that it was damaged in getting delivered, twice. I had to keep the second one because my son was going to camp and we needed it right away. Looks nice and rolls nice, but eh box is made of a thin material and rivets were missing and dents. A quality footlocker would have withstood the shipping.\n",
      "I haven't been taking it for very long but I'm excited by the simplicity of the ingredients list!  The capsules are labelled as &#34;Veggie Capsules&#34; which is slightly confusing because no where does it list what exactly is in the pills, just &#34;Forskolin Blend&#34; which...could really be anything.  I plan on doing a little more research on this &#34;Coleus Forskohlii root extract&#34; :)<br /><br />Love as always,<br />~Heather\n",
      "I started taking Gingko Biloba about 7 months ago because, as I've grown older, I've noticed that my brain processes have slowed down and become a bit muddled.By taking this product TWICE a day for the last 7 months, that 'muddy' sensation in my brain is gone, I can remember the little things that i would normally forget, and I'm able to learn new tricks on my computer again. Thank heavens! I take one pill in the morning and another in the evening.  I am not sure if I will ever stop taking these, they help so much.  I do take the brain teasers online as well and that seems to help with my brain function as well.\n",

      "We changed from swaddlers to cruisers when our baby started to crawl excessively. The diapers moved with her better and gave a lot better coverage. Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]]. It absorbs well so it's not left all messy and residue on the diaper when you put a fresh one on. Anything still there at the next change wipes right off her bottom with ease too.\n",

      "I'm enjoying my very first Perlier purchase! It's working well and the 99% Shea will last me a long time. I just scrape a little off, let it melt in my hands, and smooth over dry elbows and heals. It doesn't quite last a full day for me, but close!\n",
      "There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.\n",

I have tried Rogaine Foam, Nizoral shampoo and S5 cream, these are top products for hair fall and thinning as well as baldness and they're really effective but has some side effects like dandruff and flaking. However, when I tried VITA RESTORE it maxed out these products. My hair thickened and shines. I've also grown hair for about 2 inches in length which is really great. The dandruff that my previous cream causes now disappeared. And my nails look healthier and growing fast... This is truly one of the best remedies I tried. It's cheaper too!\n",

      "I purchased Herbalife a few months ago at my local health retailer and had high hopes for this with the numerous good reviews I read. Although, after using it for 6 weeks fairly regularly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Normally people keep eating unhealthy or don't stay active during the use of these kinds of products, but I didn't do that at all. I honestly didn't lose more than 2 pounds at any time during the use of this product. It was hard to comprehend that even after that much regular use, I wasn't losing weight.<br /><br />After realizing this, I decided to try something new. After consulting with friends and family, I went with a product that has been nothing short of AMAZING. I have lost 23 pounds in the last 7 weeks and I have never felt better. This is only the start! I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long to find something that worked for me.<br /><br />If you want to actually lose weight, take a look at this item here on Amazon and give it a chance ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1jSaoQQ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the product for you, I'm at least glad I could share my experience about this product and how it did not work for me.

I have been unable to grow back my eyebrows after an accident a few years ago. I purchased this balm, and It's like a miracle for me. My eyebrows are finally starting to grow back, evenly and nicely. If you want a fast acting balm that doesn't have the real effect, don't buy this. If you want something that will take some time but bring long term results, this is the best balm on the market.\n",

      "I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.\n",
      "They are a little light in weight, so they spin a bit. The flowers look realistic. My neighbors likes it, they are worth the price.\n",

      "I do a lot of running, and have recently began having some minor joint discomfort in my left knee and hip as a result of training for a marathon. After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running. It is a bit more expensive than I would like which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I have to admit it has really helped me out.\n",

      "I received this in record time, and it smells great!

      "It absorbs quickly and completely and leaves skin oh so smooooth but the smell of the lotion doesn't suite me.  I would love it if this also came in a variety pack with nice smell. I also ordered the Bay laurel foot and leg lotion and found it to be just as great. I will be ordering more of this as the weather cools.\n",
      "It is hard to control the phone through the plastic.<br /><br />I have to get it out to access the app then put it back in..the armband itself however is comfortable and the functions are excellent.\n",
      "It has a good quality considering a cheap price, compared with high end goggles and more expensive ones I found it very good in terms of design and features. I recommend this brand to newbies as well as to professionals. It's a great goggles.\n",
      "I have been using these for about 2 months and they worked pretty well, but not quite what I was expecting. I definitely saw some improvement though. I switched over to Phytoderm, [[ASIN:B00IT4POOG PhytoDermTM- The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides, 350mg! Clinically Proven! Facelift in a Bottle - As seen on Dr. Oz! Help Your Skin Look Younger And More Vibrant - Sells Out Fast!]] and within a few weeks I started to see what I was expecting from a phytoceramide. I am not sure what the difference is, but its worth the extra couple bucks for the 20-30% improvement. Both good products, but the phytoderm is certainly the better of the two.\n",
      "I was told that fabulous benefits are gained from using Phytoceramides products such as Phytoceramides capsules, Phytoceramides for skin and Phytoceramides supplements. This product has helped me in keeping the skin smooth, getting rid of lines and wrinkles, healing damaged skin and improving the firmness of the skin and elasticity. Itchiness and redness has also been reduced after using this product. However, the results were a bit slower than what I expected.\n",
      "The headset has worked great in my household. I have left them on my head and realized they were working clear as a bell downstairs when I retrieved something to drink. What clarity they have! Tune them in and you're all set. I've even laid down with them and they don't turn off like others have. All the controls are on the side of the ear piece and don't get in the way of lying on side. What a great deal!\n",
      "It wasn't so clear as advertised when I got it and it has gotten worse over time as became brownish color. Scratches everywhere and not pleasant looking after a short time.\n",

      "I swear I'm probably hoarding this balm, the perfect brow does such a fantastic job of making my brows look lush and plump. I can see the individual hairs in my brows growing in thicker and stronger than they had been, even in places where I hadn't seen any hairs growing for a long time.\n",
      "This thing makes dealing with a pineapple easy. But i suggest you buy the tall pineapples rather than the short fat ones. The unit is not adjustable, so you leave a lot behind when you do a stubby pineapple.\n",

      "Ok, no one tell my son this....but, I actually put this baby food (always use organic!) in his muffins. He hasn't even been able to tell that it's in there!<br />It's easy to mix in the batter and it doesn't change the color.<br />Even if I can't get him to eat things like sweet potatoes...he's getting them anyway! Cleaver mommy...heehee\n",

      "The reason so many reviewers have been disappointed with this product is not because of the quality.  Any tribulus product that contains 45% Saponins, is simply not going to compare to a tribulus that contains a high concentration of Protodioscin (the main ingredient responsible for the benefits I gets when taking tribulus).  The most potent form of tribulus is extracted at a ratio of 90%, [[ASIN:B007RLZDBQ Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 50 Grams]].  Even than I would still recommend combining it with some longjack or DAA, if increasing testosterone levels is your main motivation for taking it in the first place.\n",
      "It didn't fit my phone tightly as I hoped which makes me uncomfortable as the sides seem to wiggle with the slide of a finger. There are better options at same price range.\n",
      "This is all I needed. I am tired of paying more money for simple products that do nothing special, that is why I bought from Stalion. Simple brand that costs decent and that does everything the product ought to. This battery has a good performance and good price, which makes it a good purchase I guess. I can say I am not regretting this purchase so far.\n",
      "Now this is what I am talking about. I am happy and satisfied with this purchased.  I will be buying more of this.\n",
      "What do the negative reviewers honestly expect from this product? From the moment I opened it, I knew that it was exactly what I had in mind. The content could be more substantial though. That's my only quip.\n",
      "Exactly what I wanted. It's spacious inside and really don't take up much space on the door, fit neatly in place. Note to the manufacturer, please do a better finishing job at the corners. Made in America should be excellent...I will recommend this product.\n",

      "I have to say, with all of the junky MacBook battery replacements out there, I had my hopes quite low when I decided to buy this instead of buying an OEM replacement one. After a good deal of research and review reading I finally made my mind and bought this Key Power's battery and to be honest, so far it has been great. It gave me about 3 hours of unplugged power after 1st charge and cycle, and has actually improved in the 2 weeks since I got it. I'm not sure how long it will last, but the 18 month warranty makes me feel comfortable. I'm glad that I took.\n",

      "I used to use a oscillating fan to help me sleep.  But when it's cold you don't want a fan circulating air in your room all night.  For some reason the noise this machine puts out is much more soothing than an electric fan.  Just turned off a little by the price but hey, tons of people have nothing but good things to say and I am backing them up!\n",
      "This item is splendid! It fit the way I needed it to and holds my Galaxy S5 and there are no worries about it dropping out. Used it for running and it held up great!<br /><br />I have bought ones that were definitely more expensive that didn't work half as well or did not go on right. Terrific item!\n",

      "Pros:<br />-maintains the standard Zippo design and distinctive \"click\" sound when opened.<br />-very compact design, fits really nicely in my hand and pocket for easy carry.<br />-black matte finish is quite gorgeous. I wanted something different from the typical chrome finish and am not disappointed! The black finish also holds up well to use and handling.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-since the lighter is so small, you may find that the usage varies quite a lot from when it is full to empty on fuel. The flame can vary in height and intensity. Also, I notice the smell of unburned lighter fluid quite frequently. Refueling often becomes necessary.\n",
      "Worked great although I needed to update some drivers on my PC running XP to see the card. But after four months it just died, cannot re-format. Never had it in any extreme conditions, lost all my data.\n",
      "Defective, leaking.The inside hose is too small restricting water flow to about half of what I used to get from old hose. It took me a lot more time rinsing off the soap. Unless you have all the time and don't mind spending half an hour showering then don't get this hose. Save yourself the frustration.\n",
      "Original Carrera is much better I think. it is a great composition - one that stands out. Impressive juice...this will not be duplicated, ever.

      "Assembly was pretty easy, although the provided allen wrench couldn't turn all the way around, making it a bit tedious. The glass is pretty thin, which makes me wonder about it breaking in the future, and would probably look better frosted. Overall, decent value for the money.\n",

      "XS pills work on so many levels, and I think that's due to the green coffee and tea extracts that are in them. My body has reacted really well, meaning I just feel energetic and chipper all of the time. And of course I've lost weight, too, almost 30 pounds in just under 2 months. All in all, I love everything about these. Would definitely buy again.\n",
      "This works very well. I have pale fair skin and have puffy eyes with dark purple bags. I have to continue using products like this because I constantly get the bags. I discontinued use of the one I was on and did not use anything for a week. My bags were back. I started using this and you can see that it worked very fast, the puffiness was gone and the bags faded fast. They are even toned & soft\n",

      "I ordered two pairs. They got delivered much faster than the 4-6 weeks I was expecting. I think it was only 7-10 days. They are OK headphones\n",
      "When I use a product, I don't want to settle with what is just good. It has to be mind-blowingly excellent. So far, this product has only been good.\n",
      "Picked this up for my daughter, she does like the color.  Haven't taken her out fishing yet with it so we'll see how it does in actual use.  But so far seems pretty decent.\n",

      "I am still learning the art of getting these molds filled correctly, but am starting to have a bit more success. I used the ice for the first time this week and I was a little bit non-plussed by the length of time they lasted. I was using the ice inside, in a controlled-temperature environment and I can't say that I noticed they lasted any longer than say, a cube from an actual ice cube tray. However ... I still think they are worth it because the look much cooler than a cube! I am eager to try using filtered water to see if I can get crystal clear ice balls. The ball is about the size of a golf ball. I would like it to be a bit bigger (I am starting to giggle as I write this) so you could plop one in a rocks glass instead of two. However, this size also fits in tall, slim glasses. They're fun! If you're serving drinks or just enjoy a good sip of Scotch, you should have these.\n",
      "These smell bad and the nifty nose piece that attempts to keep the light out doesn't do so at all.  all I can say I like about it is the little ear bud holders in the strap I think that's cool.\n",
      "This is the easiest way I've found so far to completely cut snacks out of your diet. Within two weeks I was able to stop everything. I'm still taking the pills though because I haven't lost any weight. We'll see how it goes.\n",
      "I have this case a friend actually bought it for my galaxy s4. It protects the phone very well but the sound quality isn't that great when your talking to someone. you feel like you need to put it lauder or take the case off but at the same time if you want your phone to be safe you should get this cases.\n",
      "What else is there to say... We have a newly installed vinyl floor in our kitchen and didn't want any indents or markings from our chairs. These are easy to install and keep my chairs sliding easily across my floor and leave no dents or marks on the surface.\n",
      "A nice rapid charging case that is compact and does not add too much bulk. You will get about 2 full charges out of this case which will easily get you through 1.5 days of moderate to heavy usage. It works with iphone 6 4.7&#34; model only not to be used with iphone 6 plus 5.5&#34; model. Easy way to tell battery life by pressing metallic button on the bank once and pressing again to turn off to stop from wasting battery of the case.\n",
      "Scratches like crazy and the sides discolored quickly. My main issue is that I have dropped my phone from 3-4 feet and the bottom side of my phone is dented. I can't believe it got dented through the case.\n",
      "very good quality, as with all products from luminarc. I find the plain design interesting and more useful than having a highly decorated one. A good deal too as i bought them when teh were on sale.\n",
      "These pillows tend to be comfortable, We have these currently intended for couple of weeks and so i don't believe it has been even a 30 days since i own these, they tend to be fine if you ask me. The stiffness is actually good however I can point out to people that it is a brand new wedge pillow and so i do not recognize how lengthy would in which stiffness would last.\n",
      "The watch is good, and half a month to evaluate it.. Function is very full, then call, send and receive text messages, as long as the phone can receive messages including QQ micro channel, etc. can be pushed to the watch, but can not back.

Beyond the expected watches and mobile phones can actually connected via the Internet, this just can't pick up the phone can send and receive text messages, push missed calls and all mobile phone to receive the news.\n",

      "The counter stool is great for the price, and the fact that it is available immediately is a big plus. Most stores we went to required a few weeks to prepare. The wood has a nice smooth polish to it, the stands are very stable, and they look great in our kitchen. However there is one drawback that I have noticed. After only 2 months of use, the cushion has started to basically wear out thin. Not noticeable from the outside, but when you sit on it, you can feel the nails and wooden frame underneath. Not really comfortable after say 10-15 minutes.\n",
      "its a great read, facts to be read is just so shocking and the same time amazing, Love it, I just love it....\n",
      "It's perfect size for purse or travel. It comes in a little spray pump bottle with a lid. It has no smell, oily, it dries quickly and it's sticky. I hate having to  wait for hand sanitizer to dry. Great for people on the go. Excellent shipping time.\n",
      "I have friends and family who purchased nearly exactly the same spa and paid twice as much for it. I really did my homework and shopped around and you guys definitely had the best prices. I love this spa! It has all the features I was looking for and the quality is fantastic. Setup was easy breezy beautiful!\n",
      "Great face mask of minerals from dead sea. Shipped with prime. It gives a burning/tingling sensation for a lil while when u apply, but the skin feels soft and fresh after. All natural cleanser and exfoliator. Came with an ebook which you can download online, havent looked at that much though.\n",
      "Libro que parece haberse escrito bastante aprisa sin detenerse mucho a profundizar en los personajes. El escritor vuelve sobre el socorrido tema de Cuba, aunque no presenta nada novedoso. Los lectores no hallaran aqui algo que ya no se haya dicho antes en otras novelas.\n",

      "This chair is quite durable. I bought it for my daughter's room and she is happy with it. The seat and back are very fluffy and comfortable. The only thing I'm not happy about, is the color. I bought the blue since my daughter's bedroom walls are painted a very light blue, like the color shown online for this chair. If the chair color actually looked like the one in the online photo, it would be perfect. But it is a much darker blue than it is shown and I was very disappointed with that...\n",
      "I recently began a new fitness program that put a pounding on my 55 year old joints. I was so sore that it was discouraging me from working out. I wanted to continue making great progress toward my goal but without the joint pain. I did some research and read several reviews about Glucosamine Chondroitin and MSM. I decided to try Kirkland brand and it worked pretty well. Pain subsided a bit but my joints were still achy, but a definite improvement. These tablets are also really big and difficult to swallow. I found another supplement called Flexadrene that contains Glucosamine, Chondriotin and MSM along with over 20 other ingredients that relieve joint pain [[ASIN:B00NOG20ZK Flexadrene – Complete Joint Care Formula]]I have been taking these for a month and my joint pain is all but gone and my workout regimen is even more intense. Plus, the Flexadrene pills are much easier to swallow. Overall, this is a good product, but if you don't mind spending a few extra dollars, I suggest trying Flexadrene.\n",

      "I like it to shower with. The fragrance does quickly disappear. The bottle is only nice for appearance. I really like the honey moisturizing. that's it that's all.\n",
      "This clock is exactly what I was looking for and fits my space perfectly. Thus far it has kept great time and looks good over the mantle\n",
      "I don't really know what I was expecting when we got this. I thought that at least my toy pooch wouldn't bark or growl as much for no reason. Throughout the time that we spent on trying this however, her barking didn't let up one bit. She still barks even when the neighbor's car slams at night.\n",
      "Okay, on my part I would give it 4 stars reasoning being that its lid is not fine with those soft vegetables. However, with carrots, it's just as it has been illustrated in the photos which is what made me purchase it. That is a minor issue and wouldn't be fair not recommending it to anyone and they can be ready to make some salad which is delicious and quite appealing to the eyes\n",
      "These are real than the screen, like my friend. Exquisite craft and realize the value of the funds is truly wonderful.\n",
      "This is a unique concept compared to a lot of other teething products. There are plenty of really awesome necklaces that are baby safe for chewing and I utilize them a lot- [[ASIN:B00E7OXN22 Pendant Baby Teething Necklace - Non-Toxic Jewelry for Mom, Safe for Babies to Tug, Touch, and Chew! - Buy 1 Get 1 FREE!]]. It's a super convenient way to keep the teething toys with you at all times without worrying about them falling on the floor or getting thrown if you're out shopping etc.<br /><br />What makes this particular piece unique is that from a distance, you'd think it was actually jewelry. It's safe but it's multifaceted obviously so that makes it great for moms like me. Unless you're right on top of me you really can't tell it's beat up at all. It's great to know there's something I don't have to be embarrassed about if I forget to set it aside (we've all been there- puke on shirts...you know ladies) before we go out later or something along those lines.\n",

      "My dog won't take these. Dogs usually know when there is not good product. Is it really dasuquin in these tablets?\n",
      "I like the unit and once running it does everything expected. However, it does not like to be hurried when first starting. You need to turn it on and leave it alone or it gets locked up. Gets very annoying when trying to watch a new movie. Once started however it works great.\n",
      "This pressure oven does a superb job on roasting turkey and chicken. They come out moist and tasty in a short period of time.The feature doesn't work to well though. The rod becomes disconnected when the oven heats up under pressure and of cores it quits turning and even fell out once. If you cook without pressure it stays in place but takes longer and you loose the moistness.\n",
      "Went for the price but no major regrets. The light has to be placed at the right place without too much obstruction/ objects around. Can cover only a small area, around half a tennis court. The cord is also a bit short. All complaints were made by my son, who used it for his indoor party. I on the other hand am very content with it for the purpose that I bought it for.\n",
      "I really love this Gold Plated flatware. It is sooo beautiful. I do wish you would see if you can manufacture some matching ice tea spoons. Then the set would be perfect.\n",
      "The design on this is a lot more prominent than I expected. And although it's very thick and sturdy, it's also light as a feather, which is great. I like how it doesn't look like your typical yoga mat bag.\n",
      "The quality of this bathrobe does not nearly come close to what was advertised especially considering the high price. I can get one just as thick in any one of the inexpensive chain stores. I just touched the fabric and was very disappointed. Returned it without opening it at all.\n",
      "To be honest I was a little dissappointed with this game. I bought it becuase the store had a good deal on it and I decided to give it a shot.  I think this game has some glitches that should have been worked out before release. But I haven't had some of the problems other reviewers here are saying is in the game. If these glitches were worked out I'd give it five stars. I just don't think it's as bad as some people are saying.\n",
      "Had to send the first one back. The release mechanism was defective. No hassle returns policy, ordered the second one, but had to settle for another color...OK, the new one worked fine. Great size.\n",
      "This product was weak and barley gave me the extra kick I was looking for to increase workout performance. This product may work well for people that are sensitive to stimulants or new to supplements.\n",

      "I was surprised at how big this toy is. The assembly took a little over an hour and the girls were helping as much as they could. They were very excited and have spent a lot of time playing with it with their barbies.\n",
      "It's a nice case for the price. It is easy to slip on. It protects the phone by creating about a 2mm gap between the case and the phone. It also has about a 2mm lip over the front to protect the screen if you drop it. But I'm a little disappointed with the color cause it's slightly brighter pink than the picture shows. I was hoping for a peachy pink and it is a little brighter than that.\n",
      "The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />\"Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me...\"<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series.\n",
      "I think this product works as described but it lasts not very long at all, maybe a couple hours of increased focus and alertness but that is it.  For the price I would expect this to last all day or at least most of the day. At this rate I would need to reorder a new bottle every 2 1/2 weeks.  I'm sorry but I can't afford to do that.\n",
      "This is a toy not a medical product. It stopped working in just 1 day, the silly trumpets don't sound anymore. I'll just count it as money in trash. It's an absolutely useless product. No wonder it's priced at 30 bucks.\n",
      "Good enough for the outdoors if it was right in front of you.  You hear the mosquitoes get zapped.  its disgusting cleaning it though.  I guess you could always get  a new one.\n",
      "The lack of physical activity caused me to have cellulites on both my thighs and legs, I've done lots of exercise to get rid of them but none of them worked. I had told by a friend of mine that cellulite cream with retinol and caffeine will work and so I ordered this product, two weeks after using it on a regular basis and I have seen a significant improvement. This product is what I'm looking for!\n",
      "good price, quality is okay, but for the price is good enough,will buy few more as gift for my friends\n",
      "This is exactly what I was looking for. Prevented my phone from breaking after couple of drops also.\n",
      "I don't know why but after seeing the images and reading this I felt like I wanted to hurl really bad. It was especially annoying since I just ate some excellent sushi and I was not about to waste a good salmon roll.\n",
      "This is definitely worth the minimal time and effort. Just one pill a half hour before your meals and boom. You're losing weight and feeling better inside and out every day. At least thats the hope. For me it worked, I actually have a friend who bought them at the same time as me who hasnt had the results Ive had.. Not sure the deal but I can't be happier with what's happening with me.\n",
      "We needed a second one (I have twin boys and they could share one when they were really young, but not anymore) and this one is a great buy for the money. All the features of Pack n Play - easy set-up, etc. for under my budget. You can hardly find one second-hand for that amount.\n",
      "This bracelet is gorgeous, but I found it so uncomfortable. I don't have large wrists, but my wrist bones do kind of stick out. No matter were I placed the cuff, it was hitting my wrist bones. I had to return it.\n",
      "I absolutely love this movie!  In my opinion it is the best western movie out there.  Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are great actors. This movie is going to get watched over and over and over.  haha\n",
      "I feel some stinging in my teeth every time I use this product. And I know it really works though, because I’ve seen my teeth get a lot whiter. Overall I’m happy with this, and have no major complaints.\n",
      "I use this product to steam clean our curtains, my daughter's stuffed animals/throw pillows when I can't or don't have time to wash them. Easy to use. It's easy enough to use but it tends to get a little heavy when doing larger jobs but that would be the case with any appliance.\n",
      "Once again, dealing with them was a pleasure. It is a handsome and functional wallet, well made from high-quality materials. I expect it to give years of good service.\n",
      "Perhaps it's because I'm surrounded with a dense miasma of collective pop culture references all day, but I found The Goldfinch quite captivating. It's good to suspend the more intense inclinations of the mind and simply allow it to be submerged in the story. On the other hand, I can understand the disappointment that some might feel if they think that the quality did not meet their expectations.\n",
      "Really like these candles. Gave 2 for gifts and kept one for myself. Elegant looking and works great. Enjoying the timer option and fact that I can put in a location you would never be able to put a real candle. Put inside TV stand and adds to decor.\n",
      "The instruction page very easy to follow and understand. The fact this is waterproof is a major plus, as we do get rain and showers during the months my vegetable garden is planted and grown. I am just really happy that the squirrels and skunks don't beat me to my garden grown vegetables, and I would highly recommend this item.\n",
      "I never thought I would ever pay as much as $20 for a travel mug. But I really got tired of making coffee in the morning and having it be lukewarm by the time I got to work. This mug is the perfect solution. Overall a well-made product that I hope to enjoy for a long time.\n",
      "The display is large enough to read from across the room, even in daylight. So far it is very accurate and is happy it has a built in battery for backup, as we sometimes get momentary power hits.\n",
      "I decided to spend a few extra bucks for the peace of mind of knowing this thing was going to work without hassle. Once again, ASUS didn't let me down. Put in my i7-3770k and everything started up with no problems.\n",
      "I have wanted this watch for a long time now and finally made my purchase. I didn't like that you can't really see the LED outside in sunlight. It's OK when's the sun goes down or if you're in a nightclub. I won't return it because of the cheap price and it makes a good conversational piece.\n",
      "Nice watch for my friend's kid. I received it on time and in an excellent condition. Kids like it. I would recommend this as a good item to gift someone especially kids.\n",
      "i like how minimalist this stand is, it doesnt take up much space and it looks very classy as well. One thing i hate about it though is that its difficult to adjust the inclination, its because the stand its self doesnt hold especially when you have a glass table.\n",
      "This is actually comfortable and not at all like my last helmet which was incredibly distracting whenever my husband and I would go out cycling.\n",
      "The unit worked fine initially. However from day 2 on the signal drops every 20 minutes. I have to power cycle either the transmitter or receiver to get the units synced up again.\n",
      "This is my second Brita pitcher. The second time around I decided to go big and it is working out ok. The problem with this company is that they seem incapable of producing a lid that fits correctly. You have to hold it in place when pouring (it doesn't fit snugly; one end always sticks up). Same thing occurred with first one I owned. And yes, they were that way right out of the package. Quality control is sorely lacking at Brita. But for the price, the filter does its job so it's an acceptable product and I will keep it.\n",
      "Delicious candies, it comes very well packed, so the taste of each kind of candy was good. My only complaint is that after I purchased them, I found the same package for a better price by several dollars.\n",
      "I love the Yoda design but not the functionality of this bottle. But was disappointed because it leaked after several use.\n",
      "I was looking this with first interest buy this ... I can not buy this because I do not trust it. Please check the pictures, and the company website. This is not for Sprint Samsung GalaxyS3 4200mAh is not showing there. From where is this information?\n",
      "This brush isn't bad for getting through tangles, although it does stick a little when you have thicker hair. When wet, it seems to be more difficult to use. All around, the brushes are pretty decent for use on your hair.\n",
      "I like this product. I am in my mid twenties and really do not have any wrinkles, but I noticed that this does perk my eyes up a little and it is a great preventative for wrinkles. I trust the OZ Naturals brand!\n",

      "I'm enjoying swimming more often now compared before, i hate latex and I'll never wear one again. Silicone is the thing because it's comfortable to use, doesn't wear out easily and it's cheaper. This cap is durable and very good at keep my hair dry, I love the style as well and the toughness of the silicone. I'll be recommending it to my friends!\n",
      "I carry it around with me and jot down every idea that pops into my mind whenever something comes in that I dont want to forget. Ive been able to start two small (grass roots) businesses that have come up from nothing with all ideas written down in this notebook. Thanks!\n",
      "Definitely does the trick I have a few friend who swear by this stuff. I'm not a big fan of the taste though\n",

      "This is an awesome baby monitor IF you keep it plugged in constantly, it doesn't last very long off the charger and if you shut it off the monitor, you may as well just plug it in cuz if you turn it back on, it's dead. But sound quality and everything is wonderful.\n",
      "I use the Pro-A Serum every other day. I apply  about a dime sized amount to my face and neck after completely washing and drying my face. It has no smell at all. It is a thicker serum, almost gel like. It absorbs well into my face and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I love the results I am getting from the Pro-A serum. My skin is tighter and more firm. It feels softer and more moisturized then it has in a long time. My lines and wrinkles are going away, and I just feel younger, knowing that my face looks better.\n",
      "I had high hopes when I saw that this one was of the bestselling solar panels here. I read most of the reviews here, and decided to purchase one for my house. Once they arrived, I managed to install them and for the first day I didn't had any problem - only thing was that I noticed that panels were of low quality and fragile. Second day the charge controller broke for no apparent reason, I just saw it broken and since I couldn't fix it myself -I called support - which, by the way, was not helpful. I returned the panels and asked for a refund, because they didn't wrote in the description how fragile these were :/.<br /><br />I listened to my friend's advice, who's a solar repairman, and I bought, like he did, a Suntastic Charger ( http://amzn.to/1Ad27Vf ) which I received 4 days ago. It's strange how I never experienced any problem with these - the material was good and firm - and charger was much more practical than of the Renogy.\n",

      "These are all over my house. They work for any size room and are completely mess free. Great price for a quality product.\n",
      "its a beard growther! little bit confused but found that is cool to use . Thinking to take this one for me.\n",
      "I used this with no problem, issues, didn't drop it, etc the day before then went to use it yesterday and it will not turn on. It just literally died. They said they have no warranty. So after only 6 months of very infrequent use, just died. Would not buy again without a warranty from a company that offered one.\n",
      "I wouldn't recommend this baby seat to anyone who wants a safety to his kid. Once I got it, I put it into my car, because I had to drive my kid to the kindergarten, and once I arrived, the buckle just stuck - for no apparent reason. After a 3 minute fight I managed to free my kid from a seat and it was a disappointing experience. It happened 4-5 times after, so in the end I called support and asked them for help. They didn't had concrete solution, so I returned the item and got a refund.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I bought 65LX Seat ( http://amzn.to/1xthVzA ), because a colleague who had a 6 yr old kid said he bought it too and never had any problem with it. Once I got it - a week ago - I never had any problems with buckles, and since it had positive reviews here I wondered why I didn't purchase it prior to this one.\n",
      "Each luggage is perfect for everyone in my family. It is big enough and everything we need can fit on it. It is perfect for everyday get-outs or out-of-town trips. The only thing that I don't like about it is the wheels because they don't seem to be durable. I have this for 2 months already but I still don't trust the wheels. They look as if they will be broken for some time. But aside from that, everything is good already.\n",
      "They went out of stock in the stores nearby over night. Getting it online is the best thing to do if you don't mind waiting a little. Perfect combination of product and price too...my grandson is going to go ballistic!\n",
      "I am a massage therapist and I use almond oil at my job on a daily basis. The oil really helps soothe the skin, especially when you're working with clients who are exposed to the elements a lot. I find it provides the client with a better experience overall, especially working on their backs. My ultimate forumla is to use almond oil on fair areas and jojoba oil on the rougher areas like hands, elbows, or feet. Jojoba oil is awesome- [[ASIN:B00AJFV8L6 NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil -- 4 fl oz]]. It really helps soften the skin in those extra hard places.<br /><br />I use the stuff at home too. One dab of each oil in the morning give my hands a soft feeling throughout the day whether I'm working or not. It's great on faces and for some clients, they've told me they use it in their hair as well. The stuff is great, non-greasy, and quick to use!\n",
      "I just love how this makes my skin feel and how it feels around my eyes .I don't have lines at all but there's nothing wrong with trying new products .\n",
      "This is a very nice shower curtain rod. The color is a nice dark brown color. The only issue that I would caution is that the finish is painted on, and does scratch if you are not careful with your hooks/slides.\n",

      "This is a good product. I have been using it exclusively for 6 months or so and saw some solid weight loss. (3-4lbs a month) I have since switched over to a product called LipoPhen which seems to work much better, and I am now seeing 7-8lbs of fat loss per month. If you are a looking for a really intense fat burner/appetite suppressant, I would check out LipoPhen [[ASIN:B00I8ULAD0 LipoPhen - Advanced Weight Loss Supplement]] or LipoDream [[ASIN:B00I8US55G LipoDream - Non-Stimulant Advanced Weight Loss Supplement and Sleep Aid]].\n",
      "I'm really enjoying having a smaller hand held cheese grater. It's much easier to clean and use then my older stand up grater. I use this to grate cheese right on top of homemade pizza and salads instead of having to use the larger grater and a bowl or a plate. I also love that it is dishwasher safe and comes with a storage pouch so I don't cut my hands on it when it's in my utensil drawer.\n",
      "Good quality USB cable, such as a color change indication can tell at a glance if the full load management, but also a very reasonable price, I will have a time when they do so.\n",
      "fairly acceptable. shaves but not as close as i'd hoped for no matter how many times i go over the area.\n",
      "too small! i'm only using it for my face but i hate the idea that it is too small. it doesnt smell anything bad and i actually like the feeling of it. after 3 usage with me and my wife it change texture rather quickly. i also bought another one (circular charcoal) and it degenerates rather quickly.\n",
      "I really enjoy using camera and the convenience of the strap for hands free. Met all my expectations and then some. Has all the features I was looking for and at a price I could afford.\n",
      "Used the serum for a month and like it a lot so decided to try the eye cream too. Like how you can save a few dollars by buying the set. The serum goes on silky smooth, absorbs well and not greasy. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized all day long. Can notice an improvement in the wrinkles too. The eye cream is very nice too. Soft and absorbs nicely into my skin. Skin around my eye area looks brighter and less wrinkly. Going to buy again.\n",
      "There is nothing fancy about these envelopes. They are very basic but that is all that you'll need. They have the right format for most letters and are not that expensive.\n",
      "Good Product. Deep Inside, Nice & Stylish Outside!!. amazon Delivery is also very Quick. Good product @ decent Price\n",
      "This lasted a bit longer than the crackle bone I think simply because it is round.  It is made form light weight plastic and very easy to eat.  My girl and 11 month old puppy was able to eat this in under 10 minutes.  I was hoping it was harder plastic like the normal kong toys but not so.  If you have a chewer - don't waste the money.<br /><br />If your pup doesn't chew and just plays then I would say go for it.  But, if they are a chewer - they will eat it in short order.\n",
      "The powder certainly smelled sweet and vanilla-like but I wouldn't describe it as a vanilla milkshake.  The fake sugar taste was really really apparent so possibly the plain variety would be better.  Although the company was really nice to send me a sample, I was disappointed and wouldn't order this.\n",
      "These heads do not vibrate any where near as strong as the original Philips Sonicare heads.  Not worth the savings as I had to go buy a brand name repalcement from Walmart after trying these.\n",
      "The build of the bottle as a whole  is pretty solid. However, there were a few places, specifically the juicer parts where flash plastic got in the way of using the product. The build is solid and it feels good in the hand!\n",

      "Fantastic price for such a lovely artificial tree. This makes a great addition the ones already in my house. This tree is my new favorite!\n",
      "The cooking surface is very small and the cleaning is next to impossible. If you don't attempt to clean it while its hot, you may as well throw it away. There is no temperature setting either so it cooks everything fast or it will leave burn marks on your food. I so wanted to like this product because I wanted to eat healthier but this product doesn't live up to expectations.\n",
      "I have been using other expensive brands but came across this brand while shopping on Amazon, wish I had not made that huge mistake for falling for the reviews & cheap price. Within few minutes of applying this on my face my whole face broke out I mean major break out & my face turned all red and hot it's been a week now and I can still see patches of red dry skin on my face and forehead. I am absolutely positive that this is not pure argan oil , it is either mixed with sunflower oil or cut with other cheap mineral oils, I have never had this bad experience before with pure argan oil and I have been using argan oil for 2+ years now, the only time my skin would have a reaction or break out is if anything had either sesame oil or coconut oil in it or when the products contained mineral oils. We also noticed that this oil very thin compared to other expensive brands and my husband is researching this product and is trying to find a local lab so we can send this bottle to be tested to see what all stuff this oil contains.\n",
      "The quality of this set of crochet hooks does not compare to previous purchases of individual hooks. I purchase an I-9 crochet hook from a crafts store pre-2000 and the quality was great. These are acceptable, but not the same. Still usable though.\n",

      "I love Omega 3 supplement but the fish aftertaste is why I stop taking them.  When I saw that these didn't have a fish after taste I was excited until I discovered it did.  It is a mild after taste, not as bad as most I have tried before.  I would recommend these if you can handle the after taste.\n",
      "But this is just far too narrow. It's recommended that one should lie diagonally on a Mayan hammock but this isn't possible with this hammock. I will be returning this and then buying a \"family\" size hammock for $49 from another firm.\n",
      "We just bought this watch for one of my sons birthday gifts and he LOVES it. I am incredibly happy with the quality and this definitely gains the cool points with him. My husband also has this watch and wears it on weekends and it's been going strong and taking the beating of my outdoors man for a couple years now.\n",
      "I've really enjoyed using this treatment from the moment it was delivered. Easy to apply, smells really nice, doesn't leave my hair feeling heavy or slimy despite the oils in it—in general, this treatment turned out to be perfect for me. It takes effect on hair regrowth after a while, but I like it so much I barely noticed the weeks fly by.\n",
      "While the personal groomer works, the shaky construction quality doesn't inspire confidence. Also the brow shaper lacks a plastic guide - good luck shaving your eyebrows freehand without looking like an electrical shock victim.\n",

Hope it's as decent as these reviews bc right now I'm not convinced.\n",
      "I bought this hoping i would get a day out of my battery or that maybe I could use it as a swap battery on long trips. Unfortunately the clips on the case broke on the first use. I was careful placing it in but the materials used for the case seem really cheap. I don't know about the battery yet but it won't be very useful without a case that stays on the phone.\n",
      "I originally bought this hairband for my daughter but when it arrived on my mail and opened. I like it and tried it myself and was happy putting it on my hair so I guess I will order more of this for myself. One for my daughter and one for myself.\n",
      "Installed it easily on my phone 6 days ago. It doesn't need a manual to put into the phone and looks appealing. I am not sure about hard drops at this stage but seems to work very well with soft drops on the TV stand and bedside stool. Nice one..\n",
      "I wanted to love this supplement because it was organic, but apparently it is not what it used to be. I read another very informative review that stated that they changed the formula. What a shame!!!!\n",
      "It is a good value for a small low cost TV. The picture quality is best on the strongest cable channels. The colors are not vibrant on some digital cable channels. The sound quality is the weakest link. I'm hopping that once I connect runs it through the amplifier and sounds system, that the streaming video and separate sound system and speakers will make it a higher quality and more watch able part of our bedroom system.\n",

      "Words can't describe how much I love this coffee maker. I will gladly pay the extra couple of dollars for k-cups (over bagged coffee) for the convenience and ease of this machine. It makes delicious hot coffee in 30 seconds. You can leave the coffee pod empty and it makes a hot cup of water for tea. I've also used this product to warm up baby bottles instead of boiling water. I've used my keurig at least 3 times a day for over 2 years and haven't had one problem yet. The price is high for a coffee maker, but it literally last forever. I highly recommend this product.\n",

      "This facial brush was great the first few months. I was very happy with it. Then every once in awhile during use it would shut off.

      "just bought this and wasn't expecting too much. I wanted to have laughter skin but I am not expecting to get it from this lotion, i just like the smell of this and the skin benefits. I don't know if I already got a noticeable lighter skin with this lotion, I don't notice much because I am not so focused on checking skin changes. But overall, this is really a good lotion.\n",
      "I found that this eye cream irritated my eyes slightly. I think it's because it's currently winter where I live, and the climate is very cold and dry, making my eyes extra sensitive and my skin much dryer that normal. I think that caffeine in this product irritated my already sensitive eyes a bit. I normally don't have any issues with Passport to Organics products, and I have found the Zinc Eye Cream to be wonderful and very moisturizing for the winter. I look forward to giving Caffeine Eye Cream another try in the summer when my eyes are less sensitive!\n",
      "The instructions were ok, but I was lucky it went together correctly since the instructions do not label back and front of pieces.

      "Very interesting material but not a book that really grabbed me. Perhaps its because its not the usual kind of book I read.\n",
      "This is the great product.Its collar is really awesome. It is made of high quality of materials with great price. So really I loved it. The case is also dirt and shockproof.So I am confident that my iPad is more protected now. A very fantastic all-in-one case that I recommend to everyone.\n",
      "the item is very poor i used it twice it has no effect at all its simply useless ,and the other thing i need a spray as its mentioned .....but it was not a spray its a liquid gel and its\n",
      "I was somewhat disappointed. The bag was not as thick or as padded as I would have liked. It serves the purpose, but lacks some useful features. More padding and more pockets or dividers would have been appreciated. Still, it is a good price and gets the job done.\n",
      "I'm not sure these do much. I'm pretty sure they don't hurt anything, and it's possible my appetite was suppressed a little bit, but did not notice much of a difference in energy or weight loss. Might be better combined with other supplements for best results.\n",
      "Excellent quality and versatile product. You don't have to think twice about it. More vibrant in person.\n",
      "I really like the look of this box. My apartment is really small and I am looking for a neat way to keep things under my bed so that it stays out of the way and I can retrieve it when necessary. My concern is that I am not sure how tall this box is and I only have about 5 inches under my bed. I don't know why this product doesn't mention the height...\n",
      "Nice wood blocks, but smaller than I thought they would be. My Son loves to stack & build with them tho.\n",
      "The scent is amazing if you use just the right amount. The only problem is that for it to last all day when I'm at work I have to really spray a lot of it on and it's too much for a couple of hours but after I get to work the scent will taper off.<br /><br />I work in an office environment and the first day I wore it like 100 people asked me about it which is nice, but I could tell it was strong. I guess other brands are kind of the same but I think this one is like that because of the way its made and the scent even though it is amazing!\n",
      "Worth the extra few bucks because it's really good quality. The cutouts are neat and the case fits the S4 well. I only wish it came with a screen protector.\n",
      "The parts anchoring the handles broke the first time I use this bucket and now I'm looking at something that I wouldn't trust to clean anything with. Next time, I'm spending a little more on a bucket that can give me better service.\n",
      "What a wonderful book. Sensitively written about a very sad topic. Yet the author succeeded in not making the book sad, but a wonderful depiction of a family's grief and growth. I can't believe I waited so long to read this. I will definitely read it again.\n",
      "I really enjoy this camera, I take it where ever I go, it takes great pictures. And I make all my videos for my business with it. The only problem I just began to have is the battery life is not lasting like it did at the beginning, so what I am doing is constantly changing the brand of batteries to use.\n",
      "Seems to perform just ok, it's a battery. Came packed well, easy to put in my Note 3, doesn't look used..it's a smidge more than batteries that say their OEM, but besides the label, there doesn't seem to be a difference.\n",
      "I always wanted dreads and this IS the thing you might wanna use to get them. Really easy to use, just apply your regular hair gel on the sponge and just twist em away! Really easy to use and works beautifully. Getting dreads have never been easier. I really do recommend this!\n",
      "I saw Exposed in Boston, face out, at The Harvard Bookstore in Cambridge. Vibrant front cover, interesting premise on back cover. An unusual cast of characters, a little over the top, which is why I liked it as much as I did. A really fun read.\n",
      "This organizer works great in an office setting or at home. The organizer is durable, not too heavy, and can be used standing upright or laying on its side.\n",
      "Easy to put on, yes. But it's really hard to take it off once you're done with painting whatever it is that you were painting. Also, this taped doesn't stick well into uneven surfaces and especially wood.\n",
      "SMells really bad! Almost like rancid and old underwear.<br /><br />Do not purchase this. I can't tell if it is good on my skin or not because I can't bear the smell to even use it.\n",
      "I bought one of these a while back and even got one more for my oldest son. Really handy to have when you want to mix up a quick fix instead of stopping for fast food. Mine discolored a bit inside but that's more cosmetic than anything.\n",
      "I knew these wouldnt be that great but I didnt think they would be THIS bad! they feel SO cheap, are WAY heavier than they should be, lost both tips the first time out, the compasses dont work and the locking mechanisms dont stay lock so you have to keep tightening them throughout your hike. What a waste.\n",
      "Using this product could not be easier in keeping our pool clean, which is particularly important since my grandkids often come over during summer.\n",
      "I will not buy Viva labs again. They offer to donate $10 to a charity to leave a review. WHAT???<br />How does that create honest product reviews??? How do we know they actually do that? That is just sketch. Any company that did this, I just had to look further into. Check out their Krill Oil product reviews, other customers had similar complaints about fake reviews.<br /><br />SO LOOK AT ALL FAKE THE 5-STAR REVIEWS! Why have these customers only reviewed Viva Labs products, or sometimes nothing else. It's a little bit weird when you start to look at it. The easy answer is the reviews for charity donation bribe.<br /><br />Started to look into the company. Another reviewer pointed out that they were a Kentucky corporation but were foreign owned. It is easy enough to do a google search, so I did one but I did not find a facility. I only saw the generic office park. This is some sort of shell company or something? Even more strange. Where is their location at? Where do they make this stuff and where does it come from?<br /><br />Too many weird occurances for me to put it into my body.\n",
      "The author of \"Hell\" seems to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.<br /><br />In \"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list.\n",
      "I personally chose the f4 version of this range because it's cheaper and it's and L lens which means the optics used are way more better and you can achieve crispier photos.<br /><br />I have a Canon Eos 7d., which is a good body for this range because given the 1.6x crop of it's sensor the equivalent range of this lens is 112-320mm 2.8. It's a perfect lens for bird photography and candid photos.<br /><br />The aperture for me is not an issue because you can still produce a BOKEH when in f4.. not much but its okay.. I also tried the 70-200 f2.8 and it's way more better. It's a good telephoto lens for the price..\n",
      "Didn't work for me! Not even a little bit! Someone told me about another body slimming wrap so I decided to try it out. I didn't think it would do anything but to my surprise it really worked! I use them frequently now! I got them at [...]  Hope this helps\n",
      "This product company say it that it is a very good cream. But it didn't work properly. I just hate it.\n",
      "Didn't work on either of my schnauzers. Not even a little. We won't be buying from this company ever again!\n",
      "I've had a previous version of this and it plays so much better. the only thing this has over the u818a was that the camera is better, but not 30 dollars better.\n",
      "Good ergonomics and cuts well. We'll see how well it stays sharp. I expect it to be superior than most other clippers.\n",
      "These are just as pictured and go well with a cobalt blue pitcher I already owned .Not fine crystal, but very nice. Good size for water, vodka, soft drinks\n",
      "The product is great and easy to install .<br />Works fine, I dont think there are anything missing in the price it is offered at.\n",
      "I received this rug today and I absolutely love it. Looks a little brighter than the picture but is exactly what I wanted. Perfect for our front entrance way.\n",
      "Love the brand!  The Vitamin C serum feels great on my face!  The only problem with the product is the container! When you pump it serum out, It has a powerful squirt and goes all over!  I love the product!!\n",
      "I and this ipad cover are long lost buddies and we united a few months back.I am availing this covers services to the fullest as it just seems indestructible.<br />I have a lot of my designing on the ipad as I am an interior designer and I can't afford a single scratch on this but my kids are so rough with my gadget that I am usually running around to keep it safe but this case helped me through it.\n",
      "It doesn't work as you said. Maybe I'm doing. Something wrong It looks easy watching TV. and other person. Ding for you too. Plus I have very bad shoulder so is not that easy as I thought.\n",
      "Read this book before you travel. There are lessons to be learned from Fatal Sunset. Very good research and writing and lots of eye-opening examples of how vacations can turn deadly in the blink of an eye.\n",
      "This vitamin C serum is easy to use with the pump. I don't care for the smell but it is light. It soaks in fast and does a good job to brighten my skin, I didn't think I could ever find a serum like this that wasn't oily but it isn't. It does leave my skin soft. I very much like the results which I would give a 5 but only for the smell I gave it a 4.\n",
      "Fantastic assortment and easy to switch between tools. I keep one in my bag at all times and a spare for later use.\n",
      "Great value for the price.  Perfect earplug for traveling/sleeping because I travel most of the time. and It has nice little case.\n",
      "I am a Keurig fanatic. The K-cups are a staple of my house. I find it very convenient especially in the morning because I am notorious for running late. K-cups make it really easy to measure and be on the run. Green tea is my favorite flavor and bigelow is amongst my favorite brand. I find these cups to be flavorful and not dull like so many alternatives. I also appreciate that it's not sweetened to death like some green teas.<br /><br />There are always those mornings where a little extra flavor can't hurt. Adding a dash of green tea powder {[[ASIN:B009PICJTS All Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]} gives me the extra hit I'm looking for as well as a jolt of natural energy. I much prefer tea to coffee or other stimulants. Plus I don't have any crash which is always important. I don't need the extra always, but it's nice to have it and be able to add it accordingly without challenge.\n",
      "After using this for a few months, I can tell that my abs are slowly starting to come back.  I've been working hard to lose some weight and get back to the shape I was in in college.  After taking some supplements and using this I feel Great!\n",
      "I like this case alot because of its style, kind of reminds me of a spider. Im not into spiders but how cool it looks on my iphone. I also think the box looks cool with its hologram logo and luxury style box. The cover too a bit time to figure how to install it onto my iphone but thats the only complaint I have.\n",
      "It's been a week since I ordered RC Helicopter for my kid. (to be fair, I also love these things :)), and once I received it, I showed it to my kid and he was excited and told me that he wants to see it when it flies. So I got a joystick and saw that it doesn't receives any signal from helicopter. Firstly, I thought that it's because of batteries, logically, but the batteries were in, so I was confused. I told Amazon what I got and they said that I return the item and choose new one, because this one was out of stock :((.<br /><br />I choose another Helicopter which was far more better, It's Mini Radio RC Helicopter (http://amzn.to/12NArYx) which is cool and which worked from the first time I bought it :). In the end, my kid was happy to see it on air, so I was also :)).\n",

      "I received it on time and as per instructions used it for about 3 days and so far the only changes I've sen are a slight increase of roaches, though the instructions say that this will happen since these rodents will all come out and try to move away from the plug. I'l give it a few more weeks to see if it really gets them all out.\n",
      "I feel like I am using an exercise tubeband when I walk my dogs with this. It is hard to pull them back onto the sidewalk when they wander off onto the grass. We just wish that it was longer.\n",
      "This is a Great watch, my brother loved it and always gets complimented on it! I recommend to buy it.\n",
      "I warned my friend as the reviewers here warn other customers. If you don't want your pets to die from poison, you should stay away from this.\n",
      "The product was well packaged and easy to assemble. I ordered three and all were complete and make a great addition to our study and a good way to display our collectables.\n",
      "Working well here, good price for what you get.  The output quality of this rather good.  Laser printers sure beat inkjets when it comes to consumables.\n",

      "These pills are pretty good but for now I can only give them a 3 star rating.<br /><br />I'm almost through with the first bottle I have and the weight loss has been coming and going even though I've been taking the recommended dosage. In my first week I managed to drop 5 pounds and I was very excited because I thought I'd found my miracle pill. The week after that I actually gained 3 of those pounds back even though I was doing the exact same routine. The third week I've managed to lose 4 more pounds from where I was in week 2. It's hard to say if I'm going to get consistent results from these at this point. I'm going to go ahead and finish off the bottle and possibly try another one. For now I'm giving it 3/5 because it's clearly working and helping me lose weight, I just can't figure out why it fluctuates so damn much.\n",
      "This is my fifth vacuum and two others I got for both my sons we love them, the only thing which is personal is the extension in the handle it a bit of a pain in small spaces and a little too long but I love it.\n",
      "These sheets are very soft and silky. I have washed these a few times and no shrinkage at all, which is what I wanted. The cotton sheets I have been buying will shrink after a few washings making it difficult to put the fitted sheet on the bed. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because they do not breathe like cotton and we have found them a little warm to sleep in. Other than that they are very nice sheets.\n",
      "This is a great kit to use to remove your blackheads on your nose. It works perfectly, and it is what they used to remove your blackheads professionally! It is worth the buy, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and my nose is now clear of blackheads after usage of this remover kit :).\n",
      "Decent printing paper.  If you are looking for something cheap, then this will do the job. You get exactly what you think you're getting.  Its a little on the heavier side, so it will jam my printer once in awhile, but other than that, its fine.\n",
      "I feel that the ratings of this book aren't fair. I mean, yes, it's not the top of the literature but it's a very decent novel and the story is good. I give it four stars.\n",
      "I cannot stand a paper towel so soft it feels like toilet paper. I can stand paper towels so hard they scratch. Sparkle does everything you want a paper towel to do. And it doesn't leave paper towel lint or pieces behind. I have 5 cats and a dog.\n",
      "Jarrow products are usually great. They usually work in some capacity. This particular one sucks. It doesn't make any difference in the way I feel. And yes, I did give it a really good long trial of 2 whole bottles. I was really wanting this turmeric remedy to work.\n",

I have had problems with other brands not fitting, too short, or being unstable for picture taking but I have yet to experience these problems. I am really enjoying the new feature of Bluetooth connection. Very handy.\n",
      "The packaging on this product could be much better.. The box was delivered to our home, and it was very..... Loose. The pieces inside were definitely not as secure as you would like. So there was one piece that has a tiny scratch on it. And I'm only mentioning it because it's on the outside in the center of the crib. But other than that, the instructions were great, and it was very easy to put together. I did it by myself, couldn't wait till my husband got home.\n",
      "This is something that never happend with any TV that I bought - on Amazon or local store - and it just happend after a month of use. After I bought TV the picture was a little blur than it was described, but I could live with it. The problem started 10 days before the end of the month when picture faded out, every day, to black. Now all I see is a black picture with a sound? This doesn't has any sense, I contacted support and they were mesmerized, so I returned the item.<br /><br />I bought a similar TV by Samsung (http://amzn.to/1Bb6nSa), and the picture was good. However I never received an answer about what happened with previous TV, but it was something fishy :/, I guess it was malfunctioned...maybe.\n",

      "Maybe I am skinny enough already, but the main thing I noticed about this is that it does slip a little. Not much, not enough to be even really concerned. It is a very effective product.    That said, I do like using this. It creates a lot of heat and perspiration. That has meant some loss of weight already, although I wonder if this is simply water, rather than the fat we are promised. Will return after more time and report my final findings. All in all, a recommended product, just make sure to use properly.\n",

      "Had this product for about three weeks now and have lost eleven pounds, not too bad I guess. The DVDs are fun and high quality but I think my results would be better if I followed the nutrition plan that comes with the product. So I'm giving this 4 stars and will update to 5 if my results continue even without nutrition (I don't like changing what I eat). In any case, so far I've lost a good amount of weight and my stomach definitely looks better.<br /><br />P.S. For the one reviewer who didn't like some of the other reviews here. I bought this product on the baladea website and reviewed it since I always review my purchases here. It's not very nice to call people dishonest without any evidence. I recommend you try the product and write a comment based on that.\n",
      "I am a bit thin side and 5 foot 3 inches which is a little bit shorter than the average girl. That being said, I feel like this one size fits all thing is not working, every time I keep finding myself pulling up the waist since it likes to sag down a bit. It has become very annoying since short skinny girls will not be able to do any good exercise like they want to. Forget about running, you will find yourself like one of those saggy pants guys that have no belts. The texture is okay but not great, surely not for the price. In the mean time I will be looking at other better designed leggings\n",
      "I was looking for satin or silk pillow covers to help prevent sleep wrinkles on my face and less \"behead\" for my hair. I have used a silk pillow case in the past & found it very helpful. I did NOT find these cases helpful at all, and in fact seem to have worse results.\n",

These are the Aqua Ionizer by Air, Water and Life that are supposed to be made in the USA but are really made in China.  I bought my unit about 8 months ago and we used it for a while but really didn't notice any difference in our health.  We are active people in our late 40's and we are always looking for ways to make us healthy.  We have read a lot about what to look for an this company, Real Spirit, put on the Internet that the machine was top of the line at a low price.  We bought it based on this information and after trying it we stopped using it because of the lack of results.  A friend of my  Wife's was over the other day and when we were talking, this subject came up.  He showed us a bunch of negative stuff online and we realized we fell for this scam.  He also showed us some other company's products and said they were certified by a USA water quality company and there were several companies like this that guaranteed their products.  Watch out for this company Air, Water and Life and boycott them.\n",

      "Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective.\n",

      "This does not work with T-Mobile 4G! I purchased this based on the item description, which says that it works with all major cell phone companies in the US, with some listed exceptions. T-Mobile is a major cell phone company, and its network is not one of the exceptions listed. I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception. Turns out T-Mobile 4G is on a different bandwidth, though you have no way of knowing that from the description of the product on Amazon's site. (T-Mobile's 2G does work with this product.) I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install. Wilson's requires a cable between the two, and took hours to install.\n",

      "This gerber multitool is a great toy for me! My wife purchased this for a Christmas gift, and I don't think I've been this excited over something so simple! The sheath is very well designed, with a \"rubber\" loop that can be attached/re-attached without taking your belt off. My preference is to put it on the Shoulder strap of my camelback (it's my new fishing buddy) for easy access. I've used every aspect of this multi tool, and it's worked great for repairing a crab pot, for taking fish hooks out of their toothy mouths, and even cutting wire. I've used the saw to cut smaller pieces of wood, have used the screw drivers, can opener, botle opener, knife and scissors without any challenges.<br /><br />The flashlight (neatly and firmly attached to the sheath) is what you would expect from a one AAA light...not long life but if used as a true back up light or for limited bursts, it will last a few months. The firesteel is awesome, as long as you have time to play with it and figure out which technique works best for you. I've started a couple of fires with it now, and through trial and error, I've learned to scrape the black finish off the steel with the file, \"rough\" the steel surface up with the file edge (it really helps to create better spark), and to vary pressure, speed and angle of striker to maximize the sparks.<br /><br />Once that was all figured out, it's become kind of a magic trick! I've been asked why not just use a lighter. Well, I can, but it's not nearly as much fun, and not rewarding at all!<br /><br />Pricy? perhaps... but to me, it's already paid for itself and then some!\n",

      "The package arrived on time, and the Pulse was very easy to install. It allows you to train the remote to control other devices (I added my Element TV and my DirecTV cable box/DVR). The Pulse  is small and easy to hide near your TV. I attached the Pulse to the back of TV screen. The remote is nice. It has a touch pad and QWERTY boards. It looks OK but feels great.

      "I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased Slim Fast after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life.

It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.\n",
      "I am very happy with my purchase it arrived just as expected. It is very well made and arrived quickly. I would recommend. Easy to put together. A big hit all around! Easy to put together, only took a couple of minutes.\n",
      "The bumper got dirty very fast and dirt goes inside the case like crazy. I'm tired of cleaning this case all the time so finally I gave up.\n",
      "Proper serving for most kids. Most kids get enough water/juice from 1 cup full at a time.Highly recommended for any parent, day care owner.\n",
      "I got these for my little ones because of the price. They are not microwave safe but they do fine in the dishwasher. Work just fine for us, you get what you pay for.\n",
      "Purchased as a gift for a college-bound granddaughter. Suitcase is attractive and easily identifiable. A good feature is the TSA digital lock which provides at least a small modicum of security. I think she will like it. I have no comment on the quality as it has not been used yet, but it seems sturdy.\n",
      "Please stay away from this product gave me and my wife both massive headaches. She ordered this and hope we get a return. I just want to warn others.\n",
      "My husband and I loved this set out of all the sets we looked at so we decided to purchase it. When we got home to put the crib together, it had a defective piece which was the threading on the right side panel hole was stripped and a screw wouldn't fit in there.\n",
      "Love the fact that they have the silicone bases, first and for most and also that they are stainless steel, and also Wolfgang puck! The only drawback is that the lids are difficult to put on and take off. More so the putting on\n",
      "Ok so here are my pros and cons, all and all I will give this 4 stars based on the products ability and use.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Large chamber to hold the spice in.<br />Pleasing look and very classy looking.<br />People said theres doesnt grind evenly but mine does.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I just have one really big con which is that it takes 6, yes 6!! Triple A batteries to run it.  Over time that would get expensive if I had not of gone to dollar tree, even then it will still rack up eventually, would be great if it was a mixture of crank and battery power, so when you are tired just use the batteries.\n",
      "My crib was out of stock for some time and this was my last resource. I didn't only get it the day promise but it was in great conditions and great style since then its been in great use by my little angel!\n",
      "Does what it is supposed to do. Wish the corners were a little sharper so the round can butt up to the edge, but the tiny rounded corners do not affect the precision of the gage. With that said, I wouldnt use this as a go-no go gage for precision case trimming of rounds. There are better methods out there.\n",
      "This item does exactly what we wanted it to do, only problem is the adhesive it comes with is weak. We ended up screwing it into the wall.\n",
      "I really wanted this to work, but it just didn't. Unless your cucumber/zucchini/carrot is very large this won't spiralize it, it will just decimate your produce. It's kind of cheap feeling too, one of the metal supports on the side popped off during washing.\n",
      "Ever since I got a Rottweiler I knew the importance of training him regularly. I bought the collar as an additional training tool but as soon as I started using it I realized I would never need anything else. My dog started to respond quicker to my commands and behaved himself when he met stranger. The collar works like a charm and if it's good enough to train a male Rottweiler it should be good enough for all other breeds.\n",
      "As an old BB user, I was expecting more from the new BB Q10, but I am a bit disappointed now.<br />PROS:<br />-nice design<br />-nice keyboard<br />-good display<br />-16GB and 4G<br /><br />CONS:<br />-low battery life<br />-takes forever to boot<br />-slow in different common operations (ie: opening the Contacts list)<br />- materials of which it is made are cheaper compared to the old models<br />- bad pictures quality\n",
      "I was hoping to increase the amount of vigor in my workout. This did not help me to do that, in fact I even felt a little bit more lethargic. It was a shame because I was hoping that it would give me more power to do more with my body. I will stick to drinking redbull, rockstar, monster kind of energy drinks because that's the only thing that works for me.\n",
      "I highly advise this product, this is a great accessory for me an I think for all the game lovers, who can't see the burning PS4 and want to cool that.\n",
      "This book was easy to read and digest. I would recommend it , if you have some passion for stock market.\n",
      "We put the battery in right when we got it and it didn't work. changed it with a diff one and it still doesn't work. Will be returning it.\n",
      "Just started on this supplement to help with seasonal allergies, seems to help a bit. Will keep using and see\n",
      "The quality of the quilt is great but the color was not what I wanted. The picture looks aqua , but it is actually a light green. I bought a king and unlike most King spreads it actually hangs over the sides of the bed s bit. This is a nice bedspread, nice weight and quality.\n",
      "The sides are not straight and bended. The back scratches easily. For this price there are tons of other cases that are made better quality.\n",
      "Don't bother buying this cutting machine, because you'll end up with wasting a good money on something that cannot be repaired. Once I got the package, I wanted to install the machine via internet updates, and after I connected (hardly) online I download the latest software, but the problem was not in that. The problem was that, in every 20 minutes, machine goes off for no apparent reason. The worst thing is that the Silhouette repair center DOESN'T EXIST. so no one could repair this machine. I ended up as returning this item to Amazon...<br /><br />Once I got a refund, I bought Cricut Explore ( http://amzn.to/13Njs94 ) cutting machine which was far more better than Silhoutte version. I didn't had any problems in installing it and the fact that it comes with battery that last for 2-3 hours is really something that beats Silhouette version :).\n",
      "These stories are from the heart - and are like sitting with a cup of tea and chatting with a friend. Touching and supportive.\n",
      "This is the same line that my boyfriend said before. I'm sure, he will be happy to have this. The statement is very well written and the fabric is soft. I was tempted to wear it and I felt that it was comfortable. I can't wait to give it to him.\n",
      "The quality of this product is poor . I'm glad it was cheap, because it's way too much in shipping to send this thing back.This is listed as an women's apron, there is no possible it would fit an adult. If i would get this on me, it would tie Around my breasts not around my waist.I should have read all the reviews, but at least all i lost was $4\n",
      "I bought another one. I researched toasters and based on the reviews I bought it. It toasts unevenly at all setting light to dark. I hate when a third or more of a bagel or slice of toast is not toasted or very light.\n",
      "Doctor tested? What does that even mean? It's not worth your money. Buy your turmeric from a reputable source. This company? Just ask yourself, have you ever heard of them?\n",
      "Good watch..kids will love it... looks are good, features are also sufficient for kids.<br />ideal for kids above 12years.\n",
      "This case is not an oversell, it provides what it says it does.<br />Protects phone from scratches, damage when dropped, locks it in place when clipped to the belt, easy access even when it's inside the case, kickstand for easy hands-free video calling and more.<br />Im impressed because most products advertise over the top and don't really deliver what they promise.<br />Stalion does.\n",
      "Bought this to try with my body wash and it works great. Sponge is still in great shape after many uses and I will buy another when this finally wears out. Soft enough to use all the time.\n",
      "A real nice hoop and professional looking but the backboard isn't very durable. The first I purchased, the backboard snapped within a month. I purchased another one. Same thing! I made another purchase a year later.\n",
      "the food that comes out of this grill is so delicious, most of the time we use on weekends in the backyard and all the family gets united, that's what it is for. we cook, chicken, basically all types of meats. one of the best thing about the grill is that the smoke doesn't get so spread around like others because it has the cover on top, and it doesn't let so much smoke come out.<br /><br />one disadvantage and i personally think is one of the most important, the weight, it weight a lot and it is because of all the things that come included in it, like the slide burner and the holders on the side, but most definitely is one of the best grills in the stores, and market.<br /><br />the grill works with gas of course, which is good because the grills that work with carbon, make too much mess, is as if you had a stove in your own backyard or whatever place you'll use it.<br /><br />the little wheel on the bottom allows you to move it from any place to anywhere very easily.\n",
      "I am a teacher and the kids love the different colors of pencils. It motivates them to do their homework because its one of the prizes that we give out.\n",
      "Both cases I got cracked in the same spot above the camera. Since the case is like paper thin it doesn't withstand any sort of impact.\n",
      "I was pleased when I received this Iron.This iron is very good for the price. It presses well enough.\n",
      "For a short term weight loss - yes this is helpful. But what you need is to change the whole food consumption and this book won't really help you with that.\n",
      "These toothbrush heads fit too loosely on the Sonicaire toothbrush causing excessive vibration which is pretty painful.\n",
      "Very well put together, awesome graphic. It rides really smooth. Im able to ride this to work and not feel like my back is broke when I get there.\n",
      "I don't think my feet stinks (I hope) but this was really refreshing and dries relatively quickly. My foot feels less moist after using this. Will recommend for those with slightly sweaty feet.\n",
      "My rug is thick, comfortable, and does not shed but it does slide on hard wood floors, so you may need to order a pad as well. The color is a clean white and goes elegantly with our furniture.\n",
      "First it was noisy and really lets you know that it's in the room, then it just went caput. At least, that's what my friend told me a few months after I gave it to her.\n",
      "The fan is very quiet which is nice and we aren't worried about our toddlers sticking their fingers inside the vent and getting hurt. I wish that it had a more powerful air output though.\n",
      "My son asked for this subwoofer on his birthday, so I bought it for him. He seems to like it so far, so that’s money well spent. I just don’t understand why he wanted it in the first place though. I don’t even know what it does.\n",
      "It was nice to find something cheap at a fast ship place. The quality of product and receipt of merchandise is ok as wished. I should have paid attention before and ordered these cable.\n",
      "A great bargin and also very nice. I loved the color, size and quality. Soft & absorbant. I recommend this to all.\n",
      "I did a lot of searching before settling on this bag. It's made of beautiful sturdy leather which also smells great. It's just the right size - the step is plenty long and I've had lots of compliments already.\n",
      "This stuff did not make me feel so hot. I felt really queasy and high like I was on drugs. I hope there is nothing bad in here.\n",
      "I receive so many compliments on these glasses. I have a small face but they look & feel great. The only drawback is they are made of cheap plastic. Would pay more for better quality.\n",
      "My son received one of these for his birthday recently, sure enjoys it.  Does well in climbing over obstacles.  Worth it.\n",
      "I needed an armband to carry my S4 while running. But the store prices are about $29.99. This one looked great for a fraction of price, and I am happy to say the armband mostly stands up to what it says in the description. The strap is not very long - so it is a little tight for large arms. But the make and looks are superb. I would recommend this in a heartbeat.\n",
      "OMG these things are so loud. The one I started with was whirling and grinding like I was at a construction site!\n",
      "my falls of when i get to bumpy roads in the woods and the whole thing falls off as well, but its decent enough to be handled on smooth roads..\n",

      "Complete waste of money!!!! Don't buy this to get rid of any smell in your car. All the reviews I really wonder anyway I have no time to get a refund, I threw it in the trash.\n",
      "I had high hopes when I ordered this set of binoculars. I recently read reviews and saw mostly positive ones, so I decided to get one for myself. Once I got them I noticed a hard focus - I couldn't set a proper distance, one which would be proper for my eyesight and binoculars. The more troubling problem was that there was some scratch inside the optics, so every object around me looked fuzzy. This was really a hard disappointing experience for me, so I asked for a refund.<br /><br />However I bought a Bushnell Binoculars (http://amzn.to/13xDW5q), because of a friendly suggestion. There were more practical and the fact that they are waterproof really changed my ways of using binoculars :).\n",
      "I am so happy with these glasses. They will be great outdoors and are heavy enough that the wind will not tip them.\n",
      "Comfortable to wear not to tight. Good item to have for beginner who in the kitchen that are scare to cut themselves.\n",
      "You will be pleasantly surprised to learn of the excellent engineering standard of this product. Really, rather good.\n",
      "I get a very good signal, less disconnects than my older PCI based Netgear adapter. I like the fact that this is USB. The chipset is RealTek, so compatibility is there. I'm using W7 64bit. The antenna is thinner than the picture, but no big deal.\n",
      "I use this as my &#34;survival&#34; tool on all my hikes. It gives me great peace of mind knowing that I will be able to take care of myself if I get lost or stranded. Plus this company is based from right here in Portland Oregon! Doesn't get much more local than that!\n",
      "THREE things turned me off & resulted in me buying a COMPETITORS PRODUCT:<br /><br />1.  Water isn't pumped up to the TOP of the filter like COMPETITOR PRODUCTS.  Several reviewers compensate for the top of the filter being dry by rotating it 180º each time they fill the jug.  This wouldn't be necessary IF there was a pump that pumped water from the tank to the TOP of the filter.<br /><br />2.  The CONSENSUS of reviewers was UNFAVORABLE in terms of CUSTOMER SERVICE & PARTS<br /><br />3.  HOT AIR is on the ceiling & cooler air is on the floor.  This unit blows air HORIZONTALLY, instead of vertically.  COMPETITOR PRODUCTS blow the air vertically.\n",
      "It is a good to prevent your phones form water, it's great for my Iphone 6 which I recently got on my birthday from my parents, after using it I can say this is the most genuine thing to prevent my phone.\n",
      "I gave this bathrobe to my son as a gift. He is a young bachelor and appreciates it very much. The feel of the bathrobe is okay, not great, not the finest terry. However, it serves its purpose and should hold up for a while. It was a good buy.\n",
      "I really wasted money on this product. I had a friend of mine order it since she said that they were great, but when hers and my order arrived they barely worked. Now, they're just hanging there, looking rather forlorn and useless.\n",
      "These work pretty good. When I was doing my photo shoot last week, I decided to use these instead of my Opteka reflectors.  And guess what?  They work about the same, except the Neewer reflectors are a whole lot cheaper.  And the way they direct the light on my models when I'm shooting is wonderful.  I was taken by the first photo, and I expect to be using these for a long time.  The only thing I hate is fooling with the zipper on the tote bag.  It's not faulty; you just have to take your time to line the zipper up and it will work every time.  So, if you want professional quality reflectors at an affordable price, these are it.\n",
      "if you need a table that is extremely durable, can be used in a multitude of ways and will last you a very long time. This is the table to get!\n",
      "I have purchased many mosses baskets over the years for my friends having a baby. while I loved the hood this one offered the quality was poor. i would not feel safe having anyone put a baby in this.\n",
      "Got this Garcinia cambogia for two months as prescribed. There was no positive effect of any kind.<br />Wasted period along with cash. They assure a good deal but fail to deliver very poorly\n",
      "I buy these pads to use as puppy potty pads for my 2 small dogs but these tend to come apart when I used for my puppies. I prefer the green or blue ones over these. They are small and not real absorbent.\n",
      "I am not really reviewing this product entirely for its quality. Every quality has a price that it can justify. And this set of 3 styluses at like $2 is just what you get. A cheap quality product which does its job, well most of the time at least. Had I paid a slightly higher amount, rating would have been lower. Don't expect a long-lasting or high quality stylus here. I use it only sparingly so I'm quite fine with the quality.\n",
      "The shipping was not good, but the head board looks just like the picture, very pleased. we are using this head board in are spare bedroom, the assembly was very easy to assemble and the quality was good.\n",
      "I bought this cute wallet for my niece on her 15th birthday, so my wife helped me to find this wallet. Glad that I found it and gave this to my niece, she was very happy with her new wallet. To be honest this wallet is attractive, but this wallet is for a teenager only.\n",
      "I have done a review of the pen, which my wife says works as she hoped, elsewhere. I can't comment on the functionality of these refills as it has not been necessary to use.\n",
      "So happy with this vacuum for the price I purchased it for. I have thick carpet that easily gets things embedded into it and this vacuum easily cleaned it all up! Also does hard floors as well and has attachments! I love it\n",
      "When I first purchased this product, I was under the assumption it would be a great teething toy for my 6 month old girl.  The toy had a variety of shapes and contrasting colors sure to keep my child occupied for a while.  After a few weeks of playing with the toy, I realized my baby didn't have much interest in it anymore.  First of all, the toy requires more motor skills than most 6 month olds have.  The squeaky ball sometimes gets stuck and makes it hard to push the squeaker.  The toy is also real heavy, and I'm concerned it will fall on my child's face when she's lying down trying to play with it.  Her foot also gets stuck between the bars when she's really active. The paint on the caterpillar started coming off by the time she reached 8 months old.  It's okay to use if your child is actually interested in it and able to maneuver it. However, it seems that by the time your child is actually old enough to do the toy some justice, all interest in playing with it is gone.  As far as a teething toy is concerned, I would have rather invested in a rattler.\n",
      "We purchased this faucet after reading all the reviews, and we're very satisfied so far with its performance. The installation wasn't as simple at all.\n",
      "Decent, have had pretty good tracking with this.  Wouldn't say it's anything fancy but working is good for the price.\n",
      "This baby is pretty good once you get it running, but it does come with a few issues. It took a while to setup and get used to, but I can say that about a lot of products, so whatever. Still, I hate having to be patient since I have no patience.\n",
      "So bad experience. Got defected unit and they got the return and inspected the unit said it was not defected unit. I was very unhappy because they did not check it specifically. When I told them the symptom they said they do not have the item anymore. Also I had hard time to get refund for my extra shipping cost and original shipping cost.\n",
      "Cheaply made product - NOT leather at all. The magnetic flap doesn't stay closed properly increasing the likelihood of the phone flying out of the case while it's on your belt. This case is not even worth $5. Do not buy. Returning the case is another nightmare with this hole in the wall company.\n",
      "I thought this would be a good investment a couple months ago, but I was wrong...<br /><br />The first main issue I noticed with this set is that the bolts tend to loosen during use and when it happened to me, part of the frame bent because it wasn't supported properly anymore.<br /><br />The parts seem too cheap to be on a machine that costs $500+, which makes me even wonder why it costs so much. Not only that, but it is also very loud during use and smells like a chemical plastic spell.<br /><br />After I had to deal with this, I did some research and found an home gym I was more confident would be better and exactly what I was looking for. Luckily it has been the best machine I've ever used to work out with!<br /><br />It doesn't have any of the issues I mentioned above and I can't find a thing to complain about in over a month!<br /><br />I got it here on Amazon too -----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1r7KMGa<br /><br />You won't regret getting that setup, but if you don't get it, at least I could warn you about this one after my experience!\n",
      "I keep dropping my phone since I put this case on. Somehow it made my phone more slippery and difficult to handle than before. Returned.\n",
      "Easy to clean, removes dust efficiently and above all, it's flexible. I just wish it had longer handle for hard to reach areas.\n",

      "I was so happy to find this wonderful toolkit, with such many positive comments<br /><br />BUT to my dissapointed. it can't open my watch because the range of the opener is too small!<br /><br />My watch is fossil AM 4102, compare regular watch it looks little bit bigger,but the adjustable opener can't fit this size!\n",
      "Sharp, mixed sizes, great scissors. I don't think the paper cutter utensil is worth much - hard to get the cut started, but I will keep using it and see if I change my mind\n",
      "When the purple nail polish is wet, it looks really cool, but when it dries it turns almost black and it's not very glittery. i like the plain glitter and i think it would look good with a white basecoat.\n",
      "This curtain is NOT something I would hang in a bright trendy or formal space. My boys bedroom has a blanket which matches the blue in this and his room is a smidgen dark so you can't tell quality etc. It is a simple curtain, blocks light, although you can see pinholes in the daylight so not true blackout. It does seem to reduce road noise. We live on a Parkway. So it works but nothing fabulous looking but not ugly.\n",
      "David platt is a bit of a phenomenon in my mind. His books are blockbusters for the christian faith and worth while for any serious believer. I definately recommend this book!\n",

      "These bowels are wonderful. They are very versatile in there use. The lids that come with each bowel makes it great when you are storing something.\n",
      "The only thing I don't like about it is there are some triangular slots on the side of the can that catch the trash sack when I am taking the sack out. If I take care to pull these back out of the way, it works great.\n",
      "Great product, if you're looking for a stand i highly recommend this one, cheap cheap cheap, very sturdy, the fan works great and isn't too loud (obviously you will hear it to SOME extent) and the controller charging docks charge well and you can just drop the controller right on for quick connections in those crazy firefights you KNOW your controller always dies during\n",
      "Everything is above expectation. A bit smaller than I thought it would be. Has some glitches. Surprisingly even with a quad-core it lags a bit. Has no support in xfa for mods or to root. Recommended for people who are happy with simpler phones. It looks like There is no auto bright and screen is brilliant , wish it had amoled.\n",
      "Quality not that good. Don't expect too much from this product, it is cheap for a reason. With that said, as long as you don't fill it up more than half way and with items that are very hard to chop, it works great.\n",
      "What should I say about these needles? They are great for sewing. I also like that it's assorted. I have many needles to choose from. Even my granddaughter could use it if they have project in school for sewing.\n",
      "I had to buy a new mug for my daughter, after I ruined hers. She absolutely loves Doctor Who and this mug. I bought mine too. It worked out great for me because now I have my own too. Great buy for any Doctor Who fan! We're both mesmerized by the images disappearing and reappearing. It is officially his favorite mug for hot chocolate!\n",
      "The clip on the book light did not clip strongly. The button to turn the light on and off did not work smoothly. The light was dim and blue colored. The light bulb did not work long. I do not see a way to change batteries.\n",
      "These shorts fit like a sack. While they made me sweat when I worked out, I spent far too much time trying to keep them pulled up. I would not waste my money on this product. These rate &#34;zero&#34; stars. 😖\n",

      "I initially bought this product from third party seller in CA. They shipped me knock off, on contacting amzer support they told me how some companies are running a scam and selling knock off products and they were very nice to ship me a Free replacement product. This time the product I received was amzer and I could feel the difference, this product was very good and is working very well with my iphone 5. Highly recommended but make sure it is the real deal.\n",
      "I purchased this hat for my father. He has some skin cancer issues and should be wearing a hat at all times when outdoors. The hat is very nice quality, fit perfectly and looks great on him! I was very pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "I was looking for a hat that is not too big but will keep the sun rays away from my eyes. I would use this for every jogging or walk. I just hope it will last longer.\n",
      "I use this tea tree oil for household disinfecting purposes. I would definitely not recommend this for any personal care uses as the different smell leaves me feeling suspect as to whether it is therapeutic grade or not. Overall, I'd recommend it for someone to consider for themselves due to the price, but only with the above comments.\n",
      "Works as described. The ergonomic handle is a big improvement over the traditional models. The blades are sharp, making it unsuitable for children helping around the kitchen.\n",
      "Bad experience all the way around. Didn't get the items at the same time.. And once received they didn't hold a charge as good as it should have. The picture was of a black battery when in fact I was sent a white battery. Worst experience ever...\n",
      "Perfect that you can listen to music on this Bluetooth but what's the point if the sounds quality is very low. There is no volume adjustment when listening to the person on the other end. I didn't return it because of the shipping and handling cost. I kept it as a standby Bluetooth in my car.\n",
      "The buttons on this thing is woo hard to press. Especially I use the power button a lot and it bothers me to have a hard to press button. There is no tactile feeling on volume buttons either. I keep looking at screen to see if it worked.\n",
      "First let me say that I'm a big Sony fan, but this video camera is very disappointing. It made the video quality of my 8mm look like HD. The footage was only good in the outdoors or brightly lit rooms. It's good for low resolution internet uploads\n",
      "I put this beautiful crystal spark plug niceEshop at a very reasonable price, but I like how it looks, so all my mobile phone accessories look great! Worth the money looks more expensive than happy,\n",

      "This shampoo smells really bad that I can't bear to use it any longer.<br />After trying it just 3 days, I had to give it up because of the foul smell. It smells like gasoline almost.<br /><br />I can't comment on the results because I haven't use it long enough to know.\n",
      "This product doesn't have me entirely convinced yet. But with that being said, my weight has always fluctuated quite a bit so it's hard to tell whether Garcinia really is as life changing for me as many other users are reporting. Maybe it's my metabolism or my eating habits (I usually skip breakfast and lunch, but go by on coffee until a light meal around 3pm and then eat a bigger meal in the evening). I started taking the Garcinia with my main evening meal but so far I can't tell whether it has really helped me. I will give it another month and then maybe switch to green coffee bean extract.\n",

      "When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nsrbPn<br /><br />I promise, they are well worth what they cost. You cannot beat quality!!!\n",

      "Predictably enough, my nieces and nephews tried to get into my liquor cabinet the last time they came over. So now, I have these locks to keep them out, hopefully anyway. I don't relish the thought of them getting drunk on vintages they don't understand, after all.\n",

      "Interesting movie about military school, and one that does not portray its characters as cardboard cutouts (as happens so often with movies about teens) but as real people with depth.  It does get off at a slow start but has a well crafted plot, and one does not stretch credulity; in other words not everything turns out as the audience wants it to.\n",

      "This stuff here was no good in my personal opinion. I didn't lose any weight at all and It certainly did not curb my appetite. I tried a different brand and had much better results though so I don't know what to make of that but that is what it is.\n",
      "My sister liked this ring and I can see why, she has small slender fingers, unlike mine, so I wouldn't recommend this to any one who has fingers that are a bit bigger not slender and knowing that you wouldn't wear it on a daily basis.

      "I was so excited when i came across this apple peeler. I was so tired of using my carrot peeler for my apples.<br /><br />I only gave this review 3 stars because the quality just isn't there. After the first use the spring broke on the peeler ring. I am still able to use the product it just doesn't spring back to take off the whole peel.<br /><br />I also wish the silver counter hook was mounted on the other side of the peeler. It does not hook to the counter the way it was designed.<br /><br />It was very east to install the handle just need a phillips head screw driver.\n",
      "This chrome aluminum case was a great bargain. I looked at other metallic cases that were quite expensive. The case looks fantastic with a white iPhone 4s and it looks expensive.

      "When we needed to print the apple located the Epson workforce 445. I learned to scan to the apple after we put the Epson disc in. It was a fast process. slow scanning but that is the Epson. It cost more but it is living up to our expectation. The apple was the best price anywhere. It arrived on time and packaged well. It is a new experience but easy to learn. Phone help is $100. We read the book and understand the computer without help.\n",
      "It is really a quality bag and the price was really great. Works ok but wish it was a little larger, wish it had zipper instead of snap for accessories compartment, wish pocket on back had Velcro to close.\n",

      "Last year I bought a set & they do keep veggies & fruits fresh for a long time & I do save money. I bought this new set b/c the rectangular containers were presented to hold more but they don't so I returned them. The Presenter seldom closes a lid & that's b/c you can't fit much in them especially large Bell Peppers, lettuce, a normal bag of spinach etc. It's only my husband & I so it's not like I'm trying to store food for an army.\n",

      "I bought these kitchen scissors because I saw it was voted Best Kitchen Scissors. I have children so it was great that it had a safety lock feature on it. They designed for comfort, which I can agree to that after having tried it. I am left handed and it fit well. I can use it for practically anything, which holds true to the meaning of multipurpose. However, I tried to wash it using the dishwasher and that did not turn out so well. I will have to handwash it, as recommended in the description. So please be aware of this. That is really my only complaint about the scissors and my reasoning for the three star.\n",

My son is at the top of the growth chart for his height and weight.

      "I was looking for more than the typical glass set and I found what I was looking for. They are heavy, which I like, so I can use them everyday and not have to worry about chipping them. Friends and family love them! My only wish is that they were a little taller and could hold just a little more.\n",

      "I often would have liked to have on my previous KVM. Also, while you can't tell from the photo (where it looks short), the wire / cable from the main box to that toggle is pretty long (about 6 feet). Yet another little pleasant surprise: the button has a rubberized bottom so it doesn't slide around easily on the desktop.\n",
      "Fits good on my 58mm lens. Although it can be a bit loose sometimes but for the most part it stays one. If you are looking for an affordable lens hood this is a good buy, otherwise spend the money on something nicer and made by canon.\n",

      "This microwave came with plastic shrink wrapped over it. Sort of a thick shrink wrap which you have to remove. It's hard to tell it's there and it's a chore to get off. In fact, it appears they shrink wrapped the parts before they put it together, because the plastic stuff is in the seems where the oven is put together and that you can't get out. I never would have noticed it was there, but it covers the vents.<br /><br />Okay, once the thick plastic wrap is off, how does the microwave perform? As good as any other and it's attractive, but it's small, the interior I mean. I expected larger. The pizza oven could be bigger. The large frozen pizzas we get at Safeway are too big for it. Still, cut them in half and it performs okay. It's perfect for the ones we get at Costco. All in all, this microwave does the job, but I don't think I'd recommend it for someone who cooks a lot, because of it's size. But for a bachelor or bachelorette, it'd be perfect.\n",

The chart labels are clearly seen, allowing me at a glance to see what my day looks like and how many more patients there are to be seen. They are inexpensive and rock-solid with charts in them. I can't think of a better system for organizing charts to be used that day!\n",

      "I wanted to like this product but just couldn't force myself to. Was so excited to buy it as it's cheaper than some of the well known brands, however it just doesn't cut it. Carrots came out only in short slices and zucchinis became mangled stuck together, and I just couldn't get it to work like advertized. The blades look dull, and the Vegetti appears to be made from very cheap plastic; I don't know how long before this thing breaks. I guess you get what you pay for, but with what I know now I wouldn't even spend $10 on it.\n",

      "Thank goodness I got this from the library instead of shelling out money for it. Unbelievable how backwards the views are.

      "Excellent product! I just wish that the bottom was easier to put on and take off, and I wish the inside was lined with a rubber material (like some cases that I have purchased in the past). I am scared that if I drop my phone in this case, it will crack since the case is plastic and not lined on the inside with rubber. All in all, this case is wonderful!\n",
      "This painting is my serenity. Perfect for the bedroom and relaxation time. I prefer to have it somewhere I can look at it while I turn on my mini water fountain, as I listen to the sounds of the water and looking at this painting takes me to a place of complete peace. After a long stressful day at work, or as part as my meditation, this never fails me. It takes me to a dreamland while I am still awake. Having the extra added mini waterfall really brings out this artwork to an even larger scale of reality. If you enjoy peace, and clearing your thoughts, dim the lights and just let yourself go, and you will soon find yourself to be in that place of deep relaxation.\n",

      "Moving forward with my recent healthy lifestyle I decided I wanted to monitor my weight. After looking through reviews I decided this was the one I wanted. Although, I found out it is not what I was looking for.<br /><br />First off, I tested the scale by placing a specified weight on it and each time it would miss the actual weight by 2-4 pounds being either higher or lower...<br /><br />This was pretty frustrating because sometimes even the smallest drop in weight makes me happy and keeps me motivated. I wanted something that would be accurate every time I stepped on it. I dealt with this for a little while before doing serious research and getting a scale that I LOVE.<br /><br />I have owned it for over a month now and can say it is accurate every single time! I check it every so often with a weight to be sure and it has never been wrong.<br /><br />I actually ordered it here on Amazon ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1lKSlNc<br /><br />This thing is magnificent! I hope I could help others by sharing my experience.\n",

They are participating in the swimming team and they spend a lot of time training every day so I thought that this will be a great gift for them. They were very happy and after using them at the training sessions, they told me that these are the best goggles they ever got. They said that the goggles are perfect and the straps adjustment is very easy. They liked the blue color very much because it is their favorite color. As they are using them for some time now, they didn't broke and the quality didn't change. I liked the one year quality guarantee, it is a great offer but I didn't use it till now. The visibility is very good for outdoor usage while it is not as good when used indoor, and this is why I gave it 4 stars. Over all, they are well made where they protect the eyes perfectly. I highly recommend this great product. Thumbs Up\n",

      "Really great athletic tape. I'm constantly getting my ankles taped to play basketball, need to immobilize my ankles. It definitely beats the nasty white most athletes use that leaves a mess after you take it off. Since it's called Fidowrap, I'm guessing it's for dogs? It didn't really make a difference for me, but I did use the white tape to mummify my dog for halloween. Worked great, didn't come off.\n",

      "I was hesitant to buy a drumset without seeing it first, after my son broke his first set. I was pleasantly surprised with the workmanship of the product when it arrived. However the assembly instructions, left something to be desired. I ended up putting the bass thing together multiple times: first i had used the wrong tension rods and didnt know until i got to assembling 1 of the Toms, then I had leftover washers and realized they should have been placed on those tension rods. I still have a few pieces that I'm not sure where they go.\n",

      "I am streaming music from my basement to several rooms in my house. I have been looking for a solution that allows me to distribute music wirelessly. Some of the systems that I found from Logitech and Sonos were out of my budget. Also, Logitech stopped making their product. So I gave this transmitter a try. I am very pleased with the wireless range. I was a bit concerned given the small size of the transmitter unit. However, this set performed quite well in every scenario that I tried. I have located the receiver in all of my rooms and I am getting clean reception. What I like is that I can get addition receivers to place in multiple rooms. I don't know how many transmitters can be used at the same time but apparently they use a smart pairing feature that allows several transmitters to run within the same home. I don't really need the iPod cradle but this is a nice extra feature.\n",

I was looking for certain designs and it is hard to pick out stuff like this on the internet. I had no way to get to a craft shop, so I chose Amazon for my supplies. While I think I have a lot of nice things to work with for the decorations I plan to make, some of the patterns I want to use from this collection I can't because it is on the opposite side of another one I want to use. If Amazon adds more pictures, showing the front and backs of the papers, they could help customers and make extra sales from people like me who would benefit from two packs, in order to use all of the designs we'd like.\n",

I gained many great ideas from that book, including different apps and websites that make flipping my Geometry class streamlined. I received an e-mail notification from Amazon that this book was released, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-The book was filled with stories that tied into a lesson, idea, or philosophy.<br />-This was not a textbook style book, instead, it was a compilation of 21 stories or ideas.<br />-I feel that the author is very positive towards education and it's just another reminder of why I love what I do.<br />-There were several ideas to help engage my students , encourage them to work to the best of their ability, and be the best that they can be in life.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-I knew that the length of the book prior to ordering, but I wish it was a bit longer.<br />-Unlike the &#34;flipped class&#34; book that the author wrote, this book is not as cohesive and each chapter reads more like a separate book - good and bad. Overall, 4 stars.\n",

      "Interesting book. It is better than &#34;Predictably Irrational.&#34; Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<br /><br />As long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<br /><br />Citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<br /><br />For over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<br /><br />For example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<br /><br />Over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s &#34;Great Society&#34; and &#34;War on Poverty,&#34; created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<br /><br />It is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;Cargo Cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality.\n",
      "i happy this already had the amp built in....the case and cover are both made with good materials, pretty standard to the industry, the blue ligght backer gives an awesome look to it, the volume could be a little better but the over all build is good, good for what it is, mostly an inexpensive sub....the wire connects are solid and clip easily.\n",
      "This is a great chair for relaxing outside, its comfortable and sturdy too. It looks great, as well. It is easy to move around the house. However, it is a little short for a tall person like me.\n",
      "I bought this to replace my nautical grooming set that was taken out of a suitcase in an airport. This is nowhere near the product. The case is quality leather, but the manicure set is a bunch of stuff you could pick up at the dollar store that's been painted gold. Save your money, look elsewhere.\n",
      "I loved the look of these earrings. They sparkle nicely. I didn't even wear this one week and the solder joint broke on the clip and now they can't be worn. I'm returning them. Too bad because I was going to wear them at my wedding. (I ordered a new pair and they never arrived).\n",
      "This product is a good starter for anyone that wants to have some food stored away for an emergency. The quality is good, but in an emergency I am sure it would taste really good if you are hungry. I like the fact that it has a long storage life and it is easy to store.\n",
      "i have had a number of cd cases and this is by far the best one i have bought. the binders have to be the best feature on this product, that and the 16 slots that are on the inside of the case as well. by the looks of the picture, you would never guess that this thing is HUGE.\n",
      "I had a difficult time re-establish my network so that all computers on my network could print on both connected printers. Even now, one computer cannot print to the laser printer but can print to the inkjet. Someone blamed my Apple (wired) router for this.\n",
      "The doll house arrived in a huge box with tons of pieces. You will certainly need your patience with this one. The finish on the pieces isn't all that great, if you move it they tend to slip out of place, so once you get it together make sure it stays put.\n",
      "I am not sure yet how to rate actual product. I think it helps to maintain your weight and per haps loose a few pounds - but nothing exceptional for me. I do think they has the best pricing when available though.\n",
      "Most of the 5 star reviews are not real accounts.<br />You'll notice they have only reviews 1 product (this one) and the names all follow the pattern of \"First M. Last\".<br /><br />- Justin T. Hawks - See all my reviews<br />- Richard W. Blalock - See all my reviews<br />- Janice W Witherington - See all my reviews<br />- Clarence S. Espinosa - See all my reviews<br />- Desmond S. Maysonet - See all my reviews<br />- Louise H. Newlon - See all my reviews<br />- John N. Ruiz - See all my reviews<br /><br />Amazon should get rid of these kind of sellers manipulating the product review of their own products.\n",
      "Loved this concluding film in the Dark Knight trilogy! Yes it is not as good or fast paced as the prequel, but its still pretty good. I only wish they cut down a little on the narrative and made it shorter. It required too much attention to the dialogues, some of which were hard to understand. Anne Hathaway was a breath of fresh air!\n",
      "This is not the worse can opener either the best. Dnt work so good for small can like tomatoes paste kind of hard. Works fine for my beans can and veg.\n",
      "This drive is fast and looks sharp. It's a bit bulky so have some space ready for it. Installation was a snap and my first project burned with this was trouble free. I purchased them by the way. The only downside was the quality of the eject button.\n",
      "I purchased the bracelet as a present. The recipient loved the bracelet. It looked better in person than it did in the picture. The detail in the bracelet is incredible. It can be worn with formal or casual clothes.\n",

It was manufactured in February 2013.<br /><br />This is the fraudulent claim being made by Brothers Complete in the FAQ's page on their website,<br /><br />&#34;WHY IS BROTHERS CONSIDERED THE FRESHEST KIBBLE IN THE WORLD?<br /><br />1) &#34;... Within 24 hours of being made, the small batches of Brothers are delivered to it's warehouse where it is kept cool and fresh for the short period of time we have it before shipping it directly to our customers.&#34;<br /><br />If you make a claim like this then how can you sell dog food that is 13 months old?<br /><br />I went to their chat room to ask them why they are selling OLD dog food and they deleted my questions. When other people started asking Brothers why they were selling old dog food and claiming it was fresh, Brothers Complete closed down the chat room and ran!<br /><br />Their customers aren't dumb so they started asking the same questions on the Brothers Complete Facebook page and guess what, Brothers Complete shut down their Facebook page and ran like thieves in the night!<br /><br />Brothers Complete has closed their Facebook page and their chat room rather than publicly address address the issue of them selling old dog food!\n",
      "If you can afford a better one I would recommend doing it. I can go into a long review but I don't see the need, you get what you pay for. This razor feels cheap. The heads are not very flexible and the groomer is not very sturdy.  It's a pain to clean and it cannot get wet. I have bought many electric razors and I can tell you that this will get the job done but like I said before, get a better one if you can afford it.\n",
      "We were looking to get a cable modem at a great price. We found it in this modem. It gives us exactly the same features as what we were leasing from comcast. It works great\n",
      "All kinds of dirt small storage box / case. In small so maybe not great ingredients and brush, but there are few perfect nail manicure. Easy to keep a drawer drug organization, and so on. Cloves are a very nice color.\n",
      "Mine came with a big tear on one side that rendered the case useless. I contacted DIZTRONIC about this issue. They said they would send a replacement so I threw the defective case away. The days went by and DIZTRONIC emailed me again. The wanted a Picture of the defective unit. I explained to them that I threw it away when they said they would send a replacement. Then they said they were not going to send the replacement . I wish they replaced the defective unit. It seemed like a good protective case and I would definitely change my review.\n",
      "I gave it low rate because I expected the air to flow more forcefully. Overall the unit works well, and the air flow is adequate. It's relatively quiet. There is an annoying beep that lasts a few seconds when you power it on and off.\n",
      "this calculator is perfect for anyone who wants a regular, reliable and inexpensive calculator just to do basic functions. Again, statisticians and other people will not be satisfied with this; but I was pleased overall. It's a great calculator for most people; and so I'll give this a four star review.\n",
      "I washed these 3 times, hoping to soften them. They might be ok after a year of use, but they feel like cheap sheets at this point. I guess you get what you pay for! So much for a &#34;good deal.&#34; My husband is cursing my bargain hunting!\n",
      "These stickers were horrible. They would peel off  after i just placed them on the boxes. Useless for what i needed them for. Ugh what a waste of time and money.\n",
      "i like how there are so many different settings on this nozzle.it's really a powerwasher. i love it!\n",
      "This is a baby monitor only, If you try and use this for security you will be greatly disappointed. I have tried all settings, Locations and indoor and outdoor. Sensitivity is way to high turn them all the way down and they pick up the shadow of my flag waiving in front yard. If you like watching birds it will pick them up as they fly away lol. If you want to watch your baby this is perfect if you want to stay up all night. What a fail GE. Battery life less than 6 hours on the monitor part depending on alerts.\n",
      "Having this fan on my porch is quite nice, especially during summer when staying indoors is uncomfortable. It isn't perfect however, so don't expect a lot of wind. It will simply blow the worst of the heat away.\n",
      "A great book for statistics beginners and aficionados. It covers many areas such as probability, data analysis, estimation, testing hypotheses etc. He manages to explain complicated statistical ideas in a entertaining and educational way with relevant real world examples. I have read other statistics books and found this book  to be a small treasured nugget of statistical know-how. I have been able to apply some of the concepts to real world understanding and also data analysis in my own work. I found the book on top ranked statistics book and have recommended it to many of my scientist friends.\n",
      "I never thought I'd be a fan of some &#34;kids stuff&#34; but oh my. This is such a stress reliever! Way better than old school cross stitch. LOL. Being a stay in mom for almost a year now, I had to find something that will keep my mind off from all the stress at the end of a long day and aside from books, this is my new best friend. Love ém!\n",
      "This belt is very durable and good quality. I don't really knowing anything about how belt sizing works, but I wear size 34 waist pants and decided to get size 36 belt just to be safe. For whatever reason this belt only fits on the very last hole.\n",
      "I read lots of reviews before I purchased.  I also heard about it on Dr Oz.  I read all \"star”reviews, but decided to try it for myself. It was a good price.  I took it for about 2 weeks. Some reviews suggested taking it with food and water, so I did. I can't give a fair comment on weight loss effects because I feel  I wasn't on it long enough. Though I didn't lose a pound,  I moderately exercise everyday. Don't feel it really suppressed my appetite either. I gave product 3 stars because it may work for someone else. If you are sensitive to caffeine, then I suggest you don't try it.\n",
      "We purchased this for our church nursery. This product will not hold up for this kind of use. The baskets are not even toy quality. I never have a problem with items that I purchase from Amazon. However, this product is not acceptable.\n",
      "Since I own the larger Heat Surge and love it I decided to try the Mini. This is a powerful and efficient heater. I like the fact that you can carry it and place it anywhere in the home. It is compact and really does a nice job of heating a room quickly. It is also nice to watch in the evening while relaxing in bed. If you are on the fence about purchasing it, it is a great investment. You won't be sorry.\n",
      "I received the glasses, used the large 18 oz glasses for water only, hand washed, no hot or cold temperatures, and within two weeks, two of the glasses had cracks in the bottom bases of the glasses.\n",
      "My granddaughter loved it! It comes with a web site to download games, music and other activities. Needs assistance from an adult to set up, but then it is so much fun. Great learning tool for the little ones!\n",
      "I bought this as a gift for my Girlfriend and she absolutly loved it. She was super excited to put it on her desk at work, she says its a great conversation piece. It does its job and despences tape as it should. This is a great affordable girt idea that your girl will love!\n",
      "Spent $35 for an otter case.  Hard case does not fit well around the rubber case.  The screen protector that came with it had a sticker on it, that sticker was really stuck and did not come off for a long time after a lot of rubbing and scratching at it. Would not buy this again.\n",
      "Using this light as an accent in the bathroom look great gives the just right amount of light the room needed. Was really easy to install. Only thing that would have made it perfect would be if it had a separate on off switch.\n",
      "This radio is horrid. Upon first inspection it might be a good cheap radio to hold you over until you can afford a better one, but it's not even worth that title. It doesn't work! The casing is horrible. Hate it.\n",
      "The buttons are extremely hard to press and the case looks really cheap on my phone with all the bubble effect on top and bottom on the back.\n",
      "My niece turned eight last month and this is what I gave her. She look thrilled when she saw the box and when she opened it she hugged me and told me I'm the best aunt ever! I felt so happy that she loved what I gave her! We are both happy! It looked gorgeous and she looks like a princess with this necklace.\n",
      "it doesn't tarnish like most sterling. but i can't use it to make accessories because it easily chips and nicks with simple manipulation by pliers.\n",
      "I love the rug. But I wish it were a true gray like the picture. It is silver with strands of black. I do love the shag. It is a nice quality rug, and I haven't found another one I like more. Unfortunately it really doesn't match my gray furniture.\n",
      "I was given  the canon powershot A3300 by my mum as a gift after high school,its the best camera the pictures are clear and its easy to use.\n",
      "The price is certainly reasonable for these. I've found them to be bright enough in darkness, but barely visible in indoor lighting. The colors are bright and pure. The light output is adequately bright for a couple of hours, and progressively dimmer but still obvious for several hours more.\n",
      "This brand is absolutely delicious, very fragrant and excellent value for the money. Will buy this over and over.\n",
      "I purchased these grills to finish a mod I performed to a friends case. Enlarged the old 80mm rear opening to accept a 120mm fan. This grill was an excellent choice to clean up and cover the exposed fan opening to prevent his little ones from sticking their fingers in and getting hurt.\n",
      "Strangers in remote places always look at this device with awe whenever I bring it with me since they never really expect a speaker in the middle of nowhere. I have to say that the sound could be better, but what can you expect?\n",
      "These speakers are fine for what they are if you are just looking for general audio. However, for the price, I expected better clarity on the upper range. Music seems a little flat. Mid and bass is good for this size of system.\n",
      "The monitor is too small. It does not fit my needs. I need to view my child to make sure they are okay.\n",
      "Old router was fine for eMail began to stutter and freeze up replaced with 30 min to setup and ran out of the box instructions clear easy to follow great speed & range and does most demanding streaming.\n",
      "Having not suffered from any eating disorders this book was a real eye opener. It is candid to the point of being a tutorial. It is shocking. I have deep sympathy for the people who go through this mental self abuse. I hope they all find their way clear and realize they are beautiful and perfect whole. This was a well written book that held me to the end.\n",
      "I would say these tweezers are just average.  Nothing spectacular to say about them other than they are just like any other inexpensive brand of tweezers.\n",
      "Cure light pink case with magnetic clasp. Comes with two attachment straps.  One is a longer clear pink one and the other is a short pink rope type material. Overall it is a cute durable case and waller for credit cards. My only concern are the pearls stick out and I worry they may get stuck in something and tear off. The wallet has a fake leather feel to it and a hard white case attached inside to protect your phone.\n",
      "Sound is clear, and the signal is good. However, you really require line of sight for this product to work properly. Without line of sight, my Midland range is about 3 miles but not 30 miles range as they claim.<br /><br />I will recommend this instead<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WMFYH4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001WMFYH4&linkCode=as2&tag=justckem-20&linkId=VVU35NJZSSUH77QK\n",
      "I bought these simply because they were cheap and I wanted something warm to wear to walk my dogs in. Wasn't expecting much because I figured them to be throwaways. When they arrived, however, they looked so nice I decided to keep them for regular wear and find something else to wear in the woods.\n",
      "Nice range of motion--horizontal arc, foreword angle, TV rotation. Firm on the wall--three huge lag bolts that go into a wall stud, which you should be able to hit given range of motion.\n",
      "I really like the vibrant color of this wallet, and use all the pockets. I find the dollar bill compartment to be much smaller than my previous wallet, so it takes more of an effort to fit the bills in. But other than that, I like the wallet.\n",
      "The robe is well made and comfortable. However it is long - I am 5' 10&#34; and have to be careful on steps and it is a bit small around the waist - would be fine for someone with a 36&#34; or smaller waist.\n",
      "This is great for putting over my bird feeder pole. A little duct tape and your ready to go! No more soggy food as the feeders are kept dry. Keeps the birds dry or shaded when they come to eat. Bedside's this, it puzzles the squirrels.\n",
      "This was a gift for my little brother. He loves it, but the nose and eyes are made of that iron on material that's on so many shirts that will crack and peel. That was okay because it normally lasts for a while, but even before he wore it the first time the nose was already cracking off. Pretty poor quality there. He doesn't care, he still loves it, but it's still kind of irritating. Also, the strings are really short. I know it's for boys, but it fit on both my head and my grandma's head, but the strings looked ridiculously short, even on my little brother (who is 7).\n",
      "Love this ... at first I wasn't sure but once I used it... The water pressure is a significant difference from my old shower head- it truly feels wonderful and it was no problem to change out. Probably will buy another one for my guest bath!\n",
      "I am happy I bought this over the cheaper brands. This one got more power. Kills all the bugs instantly and the torch is a good addition! Rechargeable battery is something that I wanted a long time ago. Good thing it's included here. There's nothing you could ask more in this zapper. It's a good purchase!\n",
      "I am not sure I was in love with the brown color. It was rather dark. If it had been a shade lighter I really would have liked it.\n",
      "great book and a catchy title, its really amazing how the author mixed rock and roll with horror and some slender man myths all i can say this is quiet fun to read.\n",
      "I don't know if it's because I have small ear lobes but these earrings do not look right on me. I have to push the back on very tight and they still appear to be falling out. They are pretty in the box but not when I've tried to wear them.\n",
      "No argument that I like Rich Dad Poor Dad. But what Kiyosaki is doing is very unacceptable.<br /><br />He's simply changing the titles of his books and jumbling them inside so you'd think it's original. That's what he did for Cashflow Quadrant, Why We Want You to Be Rich, Financial IQ and other books.<br /><br />Get the Rich Dad Poor Dad Book but please pass on all of his other books. It's a huge waste of time.<br /><br />You've been warned.\n",
      "When I got the package I was so happy but when I opened it, I was very disappointed when I saw the item. In the picture it's shiny and very nice looking. The reason I purchased this product was because its cheap and the picture is good looking. What do you expect for a cheap product?\n",
      "Case arrived quickly, the case itself is a perfect armor for galaxy s6, only issue is there was a scratch on the case, I guess it was scratched during transit, not big issue tho.\n",
      "I have to leave the bed cover open becasue, once the fuel cans were full and could not be laid on their side, the fill nozzles were higher than the cover would allow.  Sounds good~!\n",
      "This is everything you expect in a duffel bag. It is light weight, has lots of zippers and you can get easy access into the guts of it. I like it because it is plain looking. I like that and so does another hundred people at the baggage claim. You want to put a big band sticker on your bag to find it easily. Or a big screaming patch. The bag is great though.\n",
      "The luggage itself is massive, can hold a lot of things. The hard shell is strong and protects items inside quite well. It is light, but not the lightest.<br /><br />If you are prefer lighter weight, you should try the following instead.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CXYKQOG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CXYKQOG&linkCode=as2&tag=justckem-20\n",
      "I don't know why people are dissing this laptop. I've had it for 3 years and the battery is still great. I even use this for gaming and it still runs smoothly. I had problems with it when I first bought it. The charging circuit wouldn't work and they had to replace it. But after that, it ran smoothly. The laptop can run Adobe Photoshop CS5 but lags a little. It's good enough for a student like me. 3 years ago, laptops were pricey and this fit my budget.<br /><br />My Cons:<br />It's too damn heavy if you want to bring it anywhere. My back hurts a lot after carrying it the whole day. It heats up really fast if you're gaming or programming. I actually got burns before when it got too hot and it was seated in my lap. The touchpad is annoying too, sometimes it moves itself even if I'm not even near it, but it happens rarely.\n",
      "We just bought this but so far it's been great. I bought this for my son and he thinks the flames are &#34;cool.&#34; It's easy to get him buckled and he can pretty much do it by himself. The only thing I wish it had was a cup holder but we bought this for our second vehicle so we probably wouldn't use that much anyways.\n",
      "I like the way this cologne smells, as does my girlfriend. But if fades too quickly and it's a hassle to have to reapply every couple of hours just to have it fade again. I won't be buying anymore of this once this bottle is gone.\n",
      "Every time I heated this particular soup in any microwave, the container made a popping sound and popped up off the turning tray, fell over, and spilled out. If you can catch it before it spills over completely, you will find when eating that the noodles all gravitate to the bottom and you are left with a very untasty, pasty noodle mash at the end of the serving.\n",
      "My phone is not able to recognize this card sometimes. and when it does, the transfer speed is terrible. Therefore, I tried to exchange this product but their refund&exchange policy is a night mare. I am very disappointed with it, even if the price is quite good.\n",
      "Now I can talk to men about cigars which is something I previous had no idea. The only talking i would do was \"can  you put that out sir?\"<br /><br />Now I can actually sound like I know something.\n",
      "I bought this to use for only my undergarments and after a couple of months it completely fell apart. It started getting stuck on one drawer and on the other completely came off the hinges. A complete waste of money.\n",
      "The RTX is a great tool. For those interested the Dremel flex shaft fits the RTX regardless of what Dremel will try and tell you. The soft case is a pain but it is a case as long as the tool performs well I am happy and it does. It has more then three speeds as there are selections in between the three main speeds. Again, great product!\n",
      "Adeline Yen Mah tells an interesting story of culture, abuse, and commitment. This was a new look for me at Chinese heritage. As a daughter from a wealthy Chinese family, she gives insight into the abuse that knows no economic boundary. She had a cruel Eurasian mother that added a whole new element to the traditional family. Adeline eventually moves from China to England and then to the US while trying to preserve her family ties back home. It was an interesting look at three cultures and how they affect our image of family. It was an interesting read but be prepared for a terribly abusive story.\n",
      "I am trying to control my dog who hasn't learned obedience commands is exhausting and often nearly impossible. But teaching him simple commands from this book will make a world of difference and provide a great opportunity for bonding. So thankful for this book that is so much helpful. I have learned to keep in mind that puppies have short attention spans, and it is unreasonable to expect to have your puppy's full attention for a long period of time. Keep your sessions short at first to minimize distractions and maintain your dog's attention, gradually increasing the amount of time spent on training each day.\n",
      "I think that I did something wrong that bubbles were coming out on the second day after me and my girlfriend stuck this into her kitchen wall.<br />but anyway it was great while it lasted sadly for us just a few days after my girlfriend bought it.\n",
      "i am reviewing this product after 1 year of use , best MP3 player for the given price. no problem till now!\n",
      "Here is my take on this shampoo: It is just a regular shampoo that is expensive. It didn't do a thing to my hair. Same before, same after. I do like the smell of it but that alone is not enough to justified the expensive price tag. If this is cheaper, I'll probably buy it again, but I can't afford it.\n",
      "What really matters I guess is that my son loves it, but I feel like stomping on it when he leaves it hanging around and it goes off by itself. Oh well.\n",
      "This food is great! My baby has always loved it! Very easy to travel with, easy to warm up, easy to store. It is a little expensive, but you get what you pay in my opinion.\n",
      "Love it, Love it , Love it. No Question with quality and service. It never disappointed me. Very flexible with my iPhone. I always thought how can I maintain protection with this phone from dust, scratch and fall damage. But Now I have Case Army's rubber Case. I don't worry about it anymore. Recommended.\n",
      "I lost a lot of weight taking these raspberry ketones, but I really wanted to lose it faster than this. I expected something like 50 pounds in a couple of months and instead I only lost 28 pounds in two months. I know that is still A LOT.<br /><br />On the other hand I never lost so much weight before as I did by taking this supplement. I didn't have a single side effect. No headaches, diarrhea or chest pains like other weight loss stuff make you have. Oh and I didn't have flatulence either. Some other pills I took caused me that a lot.<br /><br />So, this is actually a great product, I'm just an impatient guy. It took me years to get this fat and I want to get rid of it in months. I know that is crazy and it is my fault not the products.<br /><br />I think people should buy it and be patient with it. Even if it takes three months to lose all the weight it is worth it because you live longer when you lose the weight and are thin. Thin people don't get some diseases as often as fat people do. You don't get diabetes type II and you don't get high blood pressure as often.<br /><br />If people in your family have that stuff you need to be thin to not get it. So, buy these raspberry ketones before it is too late for your health.\n",
      "I purchased my iPad mini for $299 May 2013 and didn't get the extended warranty. (Probably should have) After the warranty ran out the screen begin to mess up. For the price, I expected it to last longer than it has. It has never been dropped or misused in anyway. I would not recommend it to anyone and will never purchase another one.\n",
      "I have been a fan of tarot cards for many years and this book helped me learn even more about reading the cards.\n",
      "Oh my! This is the one I was looking for! I love how this USB is designed with its classy and simple design.  I was wondering where to buy it since my friend said he bought this one in the mall but unfortunately it was out of stock. But then thanks to Google I ended up in Amazon and I finally found it! Got my product just today and it was perfect!\n",
      "Nice way to gather stuffed animals. Used regular nails instead of all the &#34;hardware&#34; that came with it and have had no trouble with it staying put.\n",
      "This book is really well-written. Informative, clear, easy to understand. Need a better flow though.\n",
      "Beautiful looking table. But after playing on it for a week I noticed a bubble on the felt. After taking the table apart. Seen how the felt was put on. Board then some kind of laminates then the felt. But the felt is cut to fit just the top. Not wrapped under. Disappointing.\n",
      "it does look like the photo, it just came all folded up and still has some creases. It also smelled really bad.\n",
      "I got one of these to stamp on bulshTT \"Tps reports\" and other junk that people put on my desk. My office has the worst beurocracy of paperwork. We stamp most things with CRAP. LOL!\n",

      "Meh, I've used better. I should have read the other negative reviews before ordering. Feel very cheap and not a very good price.\n",
      "What a great read!  The author paints a beautiful backdrop to a thrilling story line as you travel with the characters from California to Texas to Hawaii.  Lots of flying woven throughout.  I couldn't wait to get to the next page.\n",
      "This liner would be great if it wasn't too wide and too short. I have to hang my curtain rod lower than I would, so that this liner fits properly\n",
      "I don't know why I never had these installed before. No more hanging lingerie and bathing suits over the actual shower bar. Now I have my very own indoor clothesline. The metal finish is lovely, and it works well. Hooray.\n",
      "If you like the BEP, then you will like this DVD.<br />They are not at their best, but even then, they do put on a really good and entertaining show.<br />Their later live performances evolved, and are much better.\n",
      "Not happy with the scratches. It distracts from the cake, at least in my opinion. No one else seems to notice it.\n",
      "Work as expected - Little fiddly to fit onto the ear. Some assistance requited the first few times.<br />Battery life is good.<br />Nice bass levels.<br />Also works really well for calls.\n",
      "It feels nice and is fairly quiet as it says but mine is defective. It randomly types capital letters, wakes my computer from sleep with other dysfunctions.\n",
      "If you are going to spend this much get something quality like GlamGlow Mud.  The container is cheap and the product is low quality. Smaller than I thought!\n",
      "This was a gift for my daughter and so far they are meeting her needs. She is a college student and needed something that wouldn't break and was \"LOUD\". I checked them out when I visited her and they are pretty good for the price can't complain.\n",
      "Not bad! It still tastes amazing, though that might be because I'm a huge tootsie roll fan. On the other hand, our local store just stocked up on this and it's much cheaper there too, so I guess I know where I'm getting my supply from now on.\n",
      "I don't like about the product was the shape of the utensils. I have to get used to the shape and I didn't notice until after I purchased them that it doesn't come with a fork utensil. A lot odd pieces, but Very cheap quality. If I knew I wouldn't buy.\n",
      "I purchased this drive because a friend of mine said Samsung makes quality SSD's. It's fast and the price was OK.\n",
      "The thing which I did not like, is that as a women's backpack it is a little smaller than what I'm used to from regular backpacks. The shoulder straps are nicely cushioned, though.\n",
      "junk ---pipe pulls right out every time . top seal from tank cap leaks everytime,,u could only spray downwards cant spray upwards with this .. i would not buy this again .\n",
      "I ought this for my son and he loved it. It's perfect for his not-too-big room and the sound quality is great. I can hear some decent bass too. Guess it's a steal!\n",
      "Nothing new in this book , if you already have read something in how to master your financial life this book will not be a much help for you.\n",
      "I am nnoyed by he fact that this chair squeezes a lot: when I sit down on it and when I get up. It becomes annoying after a couple of days of intense use. The materials are pretty cheap, also. The design is nice.\n",
      "I was a long time proactive user, but didn't care for their customer service and wanted something cheaper. This system claims to be half the price of proactive, but since it comes in smaller containers, that aren't exactly true.\n",
      "It's very hard to find a keyboard protector for my laptop model so I settled for a universal one. I just use it as a temporary protection when I eat and drink while I work but remove right after I finish gobbling and gulping because I can't see very well through it. Works it purpose for me.\n",
      "This is a really comfy blanket, but when I took it out of the package there were two holes big enough to put my finger through.\n",
      "I am using this headphone for a month,it delivers good clarity.The bass quality is above average and treble dominates but it gives the quality sound worth for its price.so it is worth buying.\n",
      "I did not buy this product because the price is just way too high and it does not make sense to get just a single pad of this notebook. If they're going to charge high anyway, they might as well sell them by the bundle or something.\n",
      "This amplifier seemed like the perfect solution for my problem. I wanted an integrated solution to stream music from my iPhone to a pair of floor-standing speakers wirelessly. My speakers do not have wireless and I did not like having a separate wireless receiver and amplifier. Since my phone supports Bluetooth I gave this amp a try.<br /><br />It worked as long as the distance between my phone and speakers was within 20 feet before cutting out. The build quality seems a bit cheap but for the price I guess that is what you get.<br /><br />The real bummer however was the fact that there is a constant hiss in the audio. I think this hiss is generated by the amplifier itself. If I turn down the volume the hiss goes down. If I turn it up the hiss comes back. This is very annoying since I otherwise would have liked this product. Unfortunately this constant white noise is driving me crazy. I have since returned this unit and purchased a similar product from another vendor.\n",
      "I thought I would like it better once it arrived but it's just not my style. However, the black in it goes very well with my espresso vanity.\n",
      "It gives a touch capability with new experience to interact with the world.The only thing that I have a problem is the fact that the laptop that is shown in the pictures shows that the laptop has a CD drive but mine did not come with one. I now know not to go off what I see in the picture because the picture is just something to draw you in more. So check specifications before going to order.\n",
      "Either I really don't know what I'm looking for or this thing doesn't really make much of a difference for me.\n",
      "I've always trusted amazon sell original and quality products. I knew I was right. The battery came exactly as expected and exactly as shown on the picture\n",
      "My complaint is that the plastic protector for the head of the razor did not fit properly and has now cracked. I taped it back together. The manufacturer needs to redesign it so it fits better.\n",
      "It's amazing! I started using this and my friends really noticed this wonderful scarf, A lot of compliments I received this day.\n",

      "I've been wearing this watch for about two weeks now and love it! I like the balance of gold and silver tones on the watch band design as I had a difficult time finding a two tone watch with a balance of both colors.\n",
      "Well for me, this is a great deal. I am satisfied with it and I don't have any issue using it. I will buy another one for my granny.\n",
      "This swim cap for long hair is good, I like the design and quality. So far I haven't encountered any problems using it. I would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "This is first time trying it, and it's feel easy to use, and it will tell us when to turn on, when it got heated enough to get started.\n",
      "I was originally planning on buying the crib bedding set but I am glad I found this! It looks JUST like the Jacana set but MUCH cheaper and comes with more. The quality cannot compete with the other crib bedding set which I got before.\n",
      "I bought this briefcase to travel issue, Actually I put hundred of thing inside it :D<br />it's really great one, Hard material.\n",
      "Very disappointed in this product. If it is supposed to have no harmful preservatives, then why do they contain chemicals that can cause allergic reactions. The next thing is all those ridiculous amount of five star reviews that are clearly paid for. Bad stuff, don't buy it.\n",
      "tossed out the bottle after using this for 2 week. ONLY MADE MY HAIR loss worse and only left my hair SLIMIER after using it. looking back, most reviews posted seem FAKE I cant believe I feel for this. STAY AWAY!\n",
      "Great design, they fit really well in the ear which is very important, and it's light. but all that don't amount to much if you have a hard time hearing from it. it got really worst when i used it a couple of times doing my morning runs. Perhaps I had a lemon but as far as my unit goes it just won't do for me.\n",
      "After washing my hair with this my hair felt like hay! And afterwards when dry, it looked dried out and frizzy. I will never buy this again. Waste of my money.\n",
      "I purchased this as an upgrade for my brother in law's computer. It performs well enough that he can now play his games on his computer. For a basic gamer or just anyone that made the unfortunate mistake of purchasing a slim computer I would highly recommend this card.\n",
      "wouldn't recommend this one to anybody. the sensors are a bit slow and i have to repeatedly touch them for the sensors to work. but it fits our small bedside tables well.\n",
      "I would usually go for the fish oils. Of course the brand is always a lower price. I am unsure about how the quality compares. These are just as they say and I haven't had problems with the \"fish oil burps\" after taking them. That's about all I can say. I have been using Fish Oil since it has been deemed a healthy addition to one's diet. The only thing better than a good product is a good, cost effective product.\n",
      "I did not expect that it was too small. However the product still serves its purpose. Quality is not that satisfying. Product is just okay.\n",
      "I have tried many different phone mounts for my phone and this one is the first one that has worked. In fact, it's been perfect. After using this for few months in my car, I found its most redeeming feature is its ability to suction onto different kind of surface (uneven, textured) of my car dash. I shouldn't be messing with phone while driving anyway!\n",
      "This is a great tool. The glue stick melts very quickly and does not require to be pushed down like my old glue gun. It goes down smoothly in itself, making me finish my craft a hell lot faster!!!\n",
      "It's a BBQ tong and does what a BBQ tong does. I suppose that's a compliment these days where a lot of tongs don't do what tongs are supposed to do.\n",
      "I have purchased this product about two months ago and since then I'm using the spare batteries and I'm satisfied but still there is a problem as one battery gives the best backup and the other one is not good and gives the poor battery lifetime and that really disappoints.\n",
      "The charger is perfect for my needs. It has ample power and is convenient to carry around. I charge my iPhone and office phone (HTC Thunderbolt) with this and I can probably get at least a full charge for both phones from it. I have tried it on separate occasions and so far, I have not been able to get even 4000 mAh from it. Not a big deal for me because a full charge for each phone is all I need when traveling. But if you are counting on the full capacity as advertised, know that it is really more like 4k or so (roughly). Still pretty good given the compact size in my opinion.\n",
      "We were a bit disappointed because we have to change the filters immediately. However this product works as advertised and the shipment and delivery was impressive.\n",
      "Can't beat the price. Good quality and sounds great. I'm really enjoying it. Perfect guitar for a starter.\n",
      "I really like the curtains specially the colors. My daughter used them at a party she hosted. It was a success! Quality not all that great but then they are not for regular use.\n",
      "I used this stuff before..... you know, it works wonders for me and myself and my partner had some great night together, I give it 3 stars because I am always tired once I'm done.\n",
      "This arrived in a nice package. It works great but the wifi coverage is horrible by comparison to the linksys that I replaced with this. Saves on monthly lease fee from my cable provider, though.\n",
      "My cat is warming up to this water....he is suspicious, as most cats will e....but following he directions I have old water bowl out and not running the pet fountain will he starts drinking rom it. It is going to be a great saver 4 me....I want my cat todrink more and I think this will really be the trick to that.\n",
      "I got this bag after realizing my old sling purse was wearing out. I had high expectations because my old purse was so great. This bag has held up well. I carry a lot of things and this bag has so much room! The strap is just right. I just carry in on one shoulder though if you want it to go across your body you might look for a different bag.\n",
      "I bought this for my adult daughter and was going to load it up with pictures and music. The music part was great but the display for the pictures was so bad that it was verually a waist of time. Looking at the engine of my Victory was just a blob of crome and black. No detail at all. Couldn't see any individual cooling fins.\n",
      "This is a great book for dietbetics. I thought medicine was the only way to treat my condition for years. I didn't think it could be fixed through diet but it can. I love the way this book describes how to change your life. change is hard and it can be a little depressing at times.\n",
      "This has short cords, so I got to supply an extension for it. However, having a remote is nice. It has great lows, good mid and highs. So far, I like it.\n",
      "For only this is a very great scope, and very Accurate once you get done with the hassle of Sighting it in, but Overall I love it and would Definitely recommend this to a friend an only 4 stars because you can always Improve on something\n",
      "I choose probotics because I would often see ads and commercial on how probotics where good for your health however after taking probotics for 7 days  i have a felt no changes in my bowels or the way i felt, I am saying that i did not dislike the product I am saying that probotics did nothing to improve myself.<br />i would recommend probotics to anyone who is willing to give it a try it might help them, but it did not work for me.\n",
      "Great book .I enjoyed this book.Brilliance is an exciting &#34;futuristic&#34; story that could easily have taken place today. A fun read, can't wait to start the 2nd novel.\n",
      "My son loved Dora so much that I decided to support and encourage his interest. Compared to some of the programs I've seen this one comes with a lot more content. All the content fits together. The DVD's work well with the songs on the Audio CD, the flashcards work well with the memory game and we look at the book every night before bed. Well worth the money...\n",
      "You can use this for any lens or glass that needs cleaning really. It's effective and cheap. That's why we like it.\n",
      "These chews appear to be a great dental solution for my dogs. There is a bit of inconsistency with the size of the strips and be careful as to where your dog works on them as they will stain carpets. Overall the chews seem to do a good job at cleaning their teeth and breathe.\n",
      "My cats like the food but my wallet does not like the continually climbing prices. For the first year I bought this the price was pretty stable but it is now going up every month or every other month. Too expensive. I suggest shopping around a bit - there's bound to be a better deal somewhere on the Internet.\n",
      "Purchased this for my son's room. His about to attend school and when I saw this I figured this is the perfect desk for him. He's already going on and on about school and he felt like he's really a student now because he has his own desk.\n",
      "Best sunglasses I ever bought, I sat on them twice, dropped them in a river, and they hold up, when I put them on I feel like I can see everything in HD, lens pops out for easy cleaning, ultra light weight, adjustable for abnormal nose sizes.\n",
      "My German shepherd absolutely loves this! My stuff has been officially tooth mark-free for the first time in a very long time.\n",
      "for my project i had to do some community work,cleaning the city for a month was not an easy job and i had to protect myself from the dust in the city,i purchased 3m dust respirator and rhey served me throughout my project.\n",
      "Legion is a good tasting supplement but it does not do anything for me as far as pumps. I have no extra energy. It's almost like drinking a really good tasting soda pop without the fizz.\n",
      "we have a farm and this is going to be used around the machinery shed to keep those pesky black birds out\n",
      "This is one of the cheaper routers out there. I would suggest going for one that is a little bit more that will last a lot longer and work 10x better.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AZP8EW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001AZP8EW&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwworkoutwei-20\n",
      "If evaluated for what it is - an energy bar - this measures up to my expectations. I carry this in my bag for emergency energy when I'm traveling or otherwise unable to get regular food. The flavor and texture are very satisfying and it doesn't leave a metallic aftertaste as some bars do. The texture is not too dense or overly crunchy - just the right balance.\n",
      "Too soft, not enough stability. Loved the fact that it was a pillow top, however, I like to sit up in bed, which is not conducive with this mattress; unless, of course, you want to feel like you are sinking.\n",
      "I ordered this because I love latex pillows and have been trying to find a good match to one I have at home that is on its' last legs. This pillow is airy and comfy, but thicker than I'd hoped for :( It does have a very weird odor as everyone else has mentioned- I aired it out outside and then put an older, recently used pillowcase on top of it. The smell didn't bother me when I went to sleep, and seemed to have disappeared almost immediately- I've had the pillow for about a month now. I like enough to keep it, but I will not buy it again unless it comes in a thinner width.\n",
      "The child unit doesn't mount to the wall so unless you have a tall piece of furniture to sit it on you're kind of out of luck. There is a major delay between the child and parental unit. We can hear our daughter cry out from her room before the monitor picks\n",
      "To say this book is useful to all is an understatement, but unfortunately not everyone thinks that way. Yes the book can be boring, yes the book is dry, but when have you ever enjoyed learning like you enjoy a movie? If you want to help yourself out in life check this out, do the exercises, just give it your best shot, but actually try.\n",
      "I don't really see a difference in my hair. I've been taking it almost a month, so maybe I need to give it a little more time.\n",
      "This is sadly a horrible product. I've been encountering problems using this. First, it sometimes won't read and those are times I go panicking, thinking it needed to be reformatted. Second, it got some scratches and that's really disappointing. It got me thinking that this is cheaply made yet expensive. Not worth it really.\n",
      "It is a messy product. It stains my shirt and pillow. It makes me itchy like crazy. I will feel better if it worked for me. But it didn't after over four months.\n",
      "Very good sound for the price I paid. Was amazed at how powerful the speakers were. I use these for my laptop. It came in handy watching movies and listening to music.\n",
      "Very useful product for cleaning PC, windows, curtains. Its a do it yourself easy product for house wives and home makers.\n",
      "This is the second piece that I have ordered from them and again I was pleasantly surprised! It did however have a small dent on top, but for the price and the fact that it will be covered anyway, it wasn't worth returning.\n",
      "I used to build for fun and profit, now I just build because I'm ready for a new machine. I don't want to tinker much, I'm looking for reliability and stability.\n",
      "As much as I like my galaxy tab, I needed a real keyboard to do the emails - touch screen just doesn't cut it. These keyboards are perfect for that purpose. The case fits the galaxy tab perfectly. The keyboard connected to the tablet without any glitch although you can see the instructions are written by someone whose native language is not English. I also like the fact that keyboard can be removed from the case making it less bulky if you wish so!\n",
      "The bows are of poor quality and colors seem dull in comparison to what is shown on picture.  I was hoping that it will look much brighter and cheery.\n",
      "I feel like the product was falsely advertised. Even if the cord works, it does not allow you to connect a computer to a TV.  Just don't work, from Video camera out put RCA to the Monitor.\n",
      "Speakers sound like crap when there up too loud. Also, when plugging in my headphones into the headphone socket about 7 or 8 times, the headphone socket caved inside the construction of the speaker! Save up more and buy a better set, Go with Creative or Altec Lansing.\n",
      "Even with constant use, this product has not displayed any damage or wear. The distribution of the marinade has been amazing as well, so each meat has the same amount of flavor and thus consistent with what we promise.\n",
      "My husband is a big guy so I figured XL would be adequate. Wrong. I did end up gifting this to my son and he is happy with it. Hope it didn't shrink or he doesn't gain any weight though or it will not fit.\n",
      "I wanted a red mouse pad for my red mouse. Too bad it wasn't available in store as it was a waste of a rather large box and packing material. I have what you call a red room. I have a red futon, from here. Red valences and red lamps. So I now have everything.\n",
      "I was initially a little unsure about buying a new product rather than going for old school razer and steel series. But then, I went along and took the risk. And I got worth my money. Large, smooth, elegant with great texture and design. Yes you can get better if you are willing to spend more, but at this price, it's awesome.\n",
      "This design is ugly and the lines going around do not connect and the painting is sloppy. They are very large. The only thing i do like is that they are lightweight\n",
      "I wore a sexy evening gown that's why I purchased this push-up bra breast pad. I'm comfortable wearing it all throughout the night. I love it!\n",
      "I got this for my '03 Honda because my lights were starting to get dim when I drove at night. It works great. I would say my headlights are 10 times clearer than before. When I saw the picture at first I thought it would be very hard to use but it wasn't at all. It comes with everything you need and this one is very affordable I'm impressed.\n",
      "So for the pros first:<br /><br />I use it on my face as an night time moisturizer and it seems to do the trick well. Absorbs and keeps my face hydrated.<br /><br />However, my intention was using this as a hair product. I am already currently using my night cream for my face at night which does an amazing job also and is slightly cheaper.<br /><br />As for hair product, I am switching from the blue label Moroccan oil to this and this one is oily and doesn't help with frizz as much.<br /><br />That is the reason for 2 star because I did not get to use it for what I want to.\n",
      "It's a very great value for the price. It's a well-made medicine ball that's perfect in shape and size and weight.\n",
      "Looking at the picture online I was a little hesitant to purchase this item. I was very happy when I received it. It looks so much better than I thought it would. It is the perfect album for my daughter's scrapbook!\n",
      "This oil is junk!<br />I don't think it is high quality because of the foul smell. And I don't see any difference in my skin after a week of using it. Stick with another brand and you'll see the results.\n",
      "It looks fine  on the phone and it is easy to remove. I would trust to to protect against falls, but to help reduce small dings while it sits on my desk, rides in my car, or is carried in my pocket to keep out dust and lint, then yes, it is good for that.\n",
      "Alarm won't sound when tested. Had a friend look at it and he confirmed that it was defective. He suggested that I stick with Kidde or First Alert.\n",
      "It took me an hour to finally install Ooma Telo on a place where my phone was. I didn't think of calling a support because I read here that they were not that helpful. Once I installed it, I called a friend just to see if it works ( prior to that I had to activate product through their website, which was an annoying process). However, friend told me that he couldn't hear me well and that he noticed a repeat of every word I say. I didn't knew what happened, since I updated software online to the newest version, so we changed places and I got onto his phone and he on Ooma. I noticed the same thing, low volume and slight delay, which really ruined the whole experience. At last I returned the item and made a fair exchange...<br /><br />I got myself a new Telo Home Service ( http://amzn.to/1vBqHZ5 ), which wasn't malfunctioned. I did had slight problems in installing it but I solved it as it wasn't a factory mistake. It worked like a clock, so I'll stick to it for now on.\n",
      "This product is not a good buy. The instructions are not clear and concise. I was not able to hang my TV with this product because of the unclear instructions. I would not recommend buying this product.\n",
      "although i wasn't expecting a lot because of how cheap i bought these towels, still i didn't think that the threads would easily loosen up at the edges after two washes. it's comfortable and soft. but the color is off. it's not as how it was pictured. it's more of light grey.\n",
      "I keep this umbrella in the back of my car and it's really nice quality, looks much more expensive than it is and haven't found a problem with it yet. I went back and ordered another one, I liked it so much.\n",
      "so far it has been really easy and nice..just love it nice gift from my uncle.<br />Awesome does what it says!, Excellent product!\n",
      "Was all excited to get new memory foam mattress, it is too soft. I read all the reviews, read on how much wt. But it is not what I wanted .My wife, and I are disappointed. We are out the money for you cannot return once opened, but you can't try it if you don't open it. Looks nice just already feels broke down.\n",

He knows he cannot change his past but he must do something to vindicate himself especially his mother... and father. He will learn this the hard way and he will become a father himself. More than forgiveness, this novel brings hope to those who are suffering similar child abuse traumas.<br />Along one's road to recovery are people who will make you feel right about yourself, notwithstanding your dark past.

      "Bought this to travel with-it is just the right size and helps to keep up with the family at home and work. However, the processer isn't very fast. Some apps do not response very fast on this.<br /><br />I would recommend the following Asus notebook instead<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LO3K0B6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00LO3K0B6&linkCode=as2&tag=hocivfd-20&linkId=NV4RKNCTMQZBIHM7\n",
      "I was somewhat disappointed as I have been shopping for a thicker mat as I have knee problems. It is a good standard yoga mat but is not \"thick\" as described. The dimension given for the thickness is way off.\n",
      "Much thicker and heavier than a regular shower liner. Can't see through it. Very good value. Only drawback it that the vinyl smell takes a few weeks to go away and a month after I put it up the folds that are there from when it comes out of the package are still there.\n",
      "The quality is okay, it looks durable too. I am satisfied with this purchase. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "I bought this for my son's bedroom. He likes it, but the picture is misleading. When you lay or sit on it, you have to keep rolling it to a shape that you feel supported. It ends up kind of flat requiring you to recline to the point you are laying down, not sitting in it as pictured. Hope that helps.\n",
      "The usage of the adapter is very straightforward: pick out the appropriate plug you need for your current location on the front of the adapter, then plug your unit into the correct jack on the back. It is a two way Adapter, allowing you to adapt in either direction. (From any country's standard to any other, for the standards supported by the unit.)\n",
      "Quality of product is good. Works fine. Do what it's supposed to do. The price is good and worth for my money.\n",
      "Great case, a little bulky. But helps to prop iPad in different positions while using and it is steady. I do use it a lot; lasting longer than other one I have no wear and tear on edges. It's good\n",

      "This Sand Toys Sandy Beach Big Bucket Beach/Sandbox Playset is cute and lightweight, and comes with a bunch of pieces.  It doesn't take up too much space, but has enough pieces to be a lot of fun.  All of the pieces even fit inside the bucket for transport and for storage.  We've used ours a few times and the kids have had a blast with it.  You can't beat the price and it works really well.  We are happy with it.<br /><br />The manufacturer provided ours for free for us to test and review.\n",
      "This is very good thread. needed lots of colors for a project I am doing away from home.Excellent value-6 spools of thread at a fabric store would cost more than this. If people are having a problem with breakage, maybe their tension needs to be adjusted. I sewed all day , using decorative embroidery and straight stitching and my thread never broke once. I would definitely buy again\n",

      "I had very high expectations from this book but after reading it, I was a bit disappointed. Even though this book has some very important lessons to teach us, I still think there were so many things missing out in it. I really like how the author relates us humans with animals, but there could have been so much more than merely just relating the two species and giving a few examples.<br /><br />I love Natura and tend to follow it all the lessons it I learn from it. It is filled with if not millions but thousands of new ways to inspire and motivate the humans, however this book lacked that spark you expect when talking about nature. So for me, its below than what I had expected. Hence the 2 stars. Thank you\n",
      "This hamper is really fantastic. It has a great look and was a breeze to set up. Based on the other reviews here is how I would comment, it does come with little pieces of foam all over but 10 seconds with the vacuum takes care of that.\n",

      "Well written book and brings across the personal battle within a teenager well, trying to fit in with the crowd while still accepting her psychic powers. The character has been beautifully brought across. Though I do think that the book could have done without certain unnecessary events particularly towards the second half, felt the story was being dragged in certain parts. Perhaps I am being overly critical. Overall it's well written and an enjoyable read.\n",

      "This carseat has great reviews in terms of how safe it is.  A look at the reports and stats involved with testing this carseat are impressive.  What they forgot in designing this carseat, however, is comfort (both for the Mom and the Baby).  My baby HATES sitting in this carseat.  It's super-narrow and deep.  Maybe the depth is what makes it so safe but I wonder if it's worth it to have your baby be uncomfortable each and every time you take a car ride. In terms of discomfort for the Mom: this car seat is heavy and bulky.  I hurt my back hauling it with a three week old so I would suggest really thinking about how much you might be moving the car seat around (I live in NYC and I take the car seat out to use in its frame as a stroller--or I used to until I decided to get rid of this monster).<br /><br />I got this car seat off of my registry and was really thankful for it but this thing is a beast!<br /><br />My husband and I recently purchased a comparatively cheap Graco carseat to use at his parents' home and my baby LOVES it.  He can flex this little legs and he slept, well, like a baby in it.\n",

      "This is a great looking bookcase for a study room or living room, and fits any size book from large coffee table books to pocketsized paperbacks, in ascending order.

      "Disclaimer: Versatile hat for me which can be used both by female and male<br /><br />This hat is very elegant looking and also very much versatile. I gave it as a gift to my mother in law and she said that it is very helpful for her. This can be use during summer to protect the head from extreme heat and also during winter to protect from too much cold.Although it is not soft to touch, the material used to create this hat is very durable and strong as it shows and for sure won't easily be broken or damaged.I must say that this is absolutely a good value for the money for me.\n",

Although it doesn't get as wide of a spread as traditional fluorescent I can keep it much further away and still get effective results.

      "I'd like to say I really liked these 'jumbo' dinosaurs. But they are not even jumbo at all. They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem. What bugs me about this set, or at least the one that I received, is that there are 4 duplicate dinos. Not just the same dinosaur in a different pose, but I mean 4 exact duplicates. When I pay for 12 dinosaurs, I expect at least 12 dinosaurs in different poses, regardless if there is an occasional same dinosaur, but not 12 dinosaurs with 4 having an exact duplicate twin. The quality is not the worst I have seen before, however in many I can clearly see the mold imprint melted into the dinos. So several look like they have had an operation, and split entirely apart and melted back together. But, what do you expect from anything now days that has 'Made In China' stamped on the bottom. Overall, I'll rate these 3 stars, and lucky they get that. Would not recommend to toddlers, but only kids 5 and up, and expect them to cry when they get 4 exact duplicate dinosaurs.\n",

      "As you can tell from the title this book it is about grace. Gods Grace. What is? How to get it? How to understand it? With that comes what it can do for you, what it has done and why we want it. Max Lucado doesn't disappoint in this book. If you have read his earlier works than you know how he writes and how he sets things up. He has a particularly dry sense of humor. Some things he says makes you go Huh? Then you realize he made a joke. If you have read Lucado before you know what I am talking about. I love the way he explains things. He makes you understand through stories and never feels like he is preaching to you. Its like having a conversation with a friend.<br /><br />\"God's grace--His unconditionally loving, unmerited favor--is sometimes difficult for people to grasp, even though each one of us is in desperate need of it. But in Max Lucado's new book, GRACE, it is completely embraceable and understandable. Through Lucado's characteristic narrative style and profound biblical understanding, we learn that God's grace is truly much more than we deserve and greater than we imagine. \" --Dr. Charles F. Stanley<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that helps you understand grace through Christ, you like Max Lucado or enjoy Christian Fiction then try out this book.\n",

I was particularly happy that it had the battery indicator lights on the bottom, as I wasn't sure that other replacement batteries had this.

      "So, first of all, the ad shows varying colors. The colors I got varied, but THEY WEREN'T THE COLORS ON THE AD. Amazon shows these very light, pastel-like colors. I got bold greens, reds, blues, and purples.  I should know better than to purchase something so cheap, but this was ludicrous. The majority of them wouldn't “lock\" into place and the other ones take a ridiculous amount of strength to set. After doing some research, I found an even cheaper (and better quality) brand. Give Clover a shot and don't waste your time with these.\n",

Jim Butcher is always good about writing the 3-act paradigm, and this book was no exception.<br /><br />The main character, Tavi, is a bit weak, and he feels like a younger version of Dresden. But he had strong supporting characters that were fun to follow.\n",

She ran out of her cereals and we both don't drive, so I ordered from here, was delivered quickly. She said the cereals were fresh and delicious.\n",
      "Got this for my birthday and overall sound quality id rate it about average.  It does a bit better than my 50\" lg that its hooked up to, but nothing earth shattering.<br /><br />Took a bit of playing around with the settings to get the sound right, and the sub provides a good bass if you turn it up.  If space is tight I would recommend this setup, but otherwise I would go for a better surround sound package.\n",
      "I started out by buying one set in a queen size and when I put it on the bed, it fell short, literally. It's really sized better for a full size bed. But I liked it as a throw for my full sized down comforter so I kept it. Next I bought the king size and it's really a queen size.\n",

If she gets the other deck, Pot Odds, I'll probably see if it will help my game.\n",

      "This was my first touchscreen phone; I got it because it was a good price, but I really regret buying it. At first it was okay, but I've had it for about 9 months now, and I get extremely frustrated with it.<br /><br />The lag is HORRIBLE. If I try to call someone, it usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 3-4 minutes to actually place the call. It gets really frustrating. I'll press the call button and wait a few minutes before it actually calls. A lot of the time I'll receive a call from the person while I'm trying to call them because they're tired of waiting for the call to go through. Then I'm dialing them and they're calling me at the same time, and hanging up ends both the calls and we have to start over. It's pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />The apps freeze and crash a lot - and not just downloaded apps, ALL of the apps on the phone. If I go to my contacts and try to call someone, the app freezes and says it has to close and I have to reopen it. This happens a lot with messaging, too. I'll try to click on a message and the app freezes and force closes. Also, there's a weird glitch where I open a message and try to type, and it won't let me. I have to tap on the message box over and over again, sometimes for a couple of minutes, before it finally lets me type. If I type a word, it shows that I'm trying to type it and then deletes each letter as I type it.<br /><br />The memory is pretty bad. I was going to just get an SD card and use it to store apps and stuff so I could have more on the phone, but most of the apps won't even go on the SD card and have to be stored on the phone, so there's really no point. I have barely anything on my phone (maybe 5 apps and 150-200 pictures), and the memory is full.<br /><br />Another weird glitch I've been having is when I press the unlock button, nothing happens, and I have to press it about ten times before it actually responds and lets me unlock the phone.<br /><br />Overall a really crappy phone - I do NOT recommend getting it. It looks good at first, but the lag and horrible memory make it a very bad choice. If I had the money to get a new one, I would in a heartbeat so I wouldn't have to deal with this piece of crap anymore. I want to throw it at a wall every time I try to use it.\n",
      "Bought this for my motherinlaw. She loved it! It's light, compact and appears very versatile. Just wish they had a different color other than blue. But I guess that makes it kind of fun. Appears maybe it is washable too! Well worth it!\n",

I like the way the connections are made which are of excellent quality. The price is reasonable\n",

      "Alright, this is a review that is based on my first week of experience. Everything is pre-installed, you don't have to do anything except connect to your screen and power supply. Of course, there are optional applications that came with a disc. Activation code is labeled on the computer. Everything works out fine. All the driver updates and applications that are necessary for your hard drive took about 10% of storage, something that I found some people do complain about. But nothing useless is found, unlike majority of pc on the market. Now as for gaming. It does allow you to run majority of games that are available. However, keep that in mind, lots of games have low requirements, so this hardware works just fine. I use mmohut as reference, but a lot game review sites have similar rating on games. For their top rate games, this computer is nothing to brag about. Many popular games have way too high requirement that is just out of this computer's league. It does allow me to play certain game like Soul of Ultimate Nation at high setting very smooth. For a casual gamer, less intensive applications, and for $500, this computer is truly a steal. But if you want to run heavy intensive games like WoW, Terra, and so on; you can settle for low setting or do some serious upgrades. My new parts are arriving soon, so I will update as soon as I can.<br /><br />Update: I bought AMD Radeon HD 7850 ($210) to replace the graphic card that came with the machine. Now this is truly a gaming computer. Everything is above 7.0 in Windows Index except hard drive. The new graphic card makes the machine runs extremely quiet, unlike before which felt a trunk driving by every single time it is turned on. Although I did upgrade the memory ram to 16GB, which I don't think it's really necessary for everyone. My advice to everyone that want to play some of the popular game today, upgrade to a better graphic card. Another thing I notice is that my computer's motherboard is GA-78LMT-S2, while current product description is ASRock 960GM-GS3 FX. They probably changed to the newer one.<br /><br />My rating still remains. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do want to run the games I like in medium to high settings smoothly. This is also my first time to purchase a built PC and have upgrade it myself. I'm ok with what it is, and can be upgraded quite easily.\n",

      "It's pretty good! It's comfortable on the head and I don't really have to strain my eyes to see in the dark.\n",
      "This is a really great addition to my kitchen arsenals, it can be used for peeling vegetables, washing rice and it can also be used to strain fruits and grains, plus a lot more! It just works effectively and nicely, but what I really like more about it is its ability to be flexed. It's so soft and can be used as a squeezer too! I just like this purchase and will recommend it to my friends. And by the way it's portable! Can be a perfect bowl for picnics!\n",
      "Cheap solution to stacks of magazines laying around. They are not going to last forever as the plastic is a little flimsy but it does the job.\n",

      "My son, age 2.75 yrs has not learned to use the brake yet. He adores this bike and rides it at any opportunity. It is great that the glide bar can be rotated 90 degrees out of the way of the feet with a simple button and whole mechanism.\n",

      "I don't know what to think about this book. In one respect I want to say trash, because without using Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre as a basis for this book it probably wouldn't have sold even one copy. One the other hand I love Jane Eyre and I did kinda enjoy this book. Not well enough to recommend it to friends, but well enough to give it a couple stars.\n",

      "This is a good Jasmine tea. Not great but good.  Its light as green teas tend to be but the jasmine gives it a soothing aroma and interesting taste.  The only thing is that it does have an odd taste I can't put my finger on. Not that it's bad, it's not at all, just leaves you wondering, \"What is that flavor?\" It's interesting to say the least.  Otherwise, this is an extremely relaxing tea as most Jasmines tend to be.<br /><br />I would have preferred a smaller size to start with but this was the only option, at least on amazon.  I also ordered a higher grade version of jasmine at the same time; [[ASIN:B00HFMON0Y Organic Jasmine Pearls Loose Leaf Green Tea 4 oz. + FREE Blueberry Pomegranate White Tea 2 oz]]  Hhmm, that free blueberry pom was not offered to me in my last order.  Anyway, I steeped this tea for 5 minutes and was just amazed by its fragrance.  I love the amazing floral note from this jasmine, no foreign taste in this one that I cannot put my finger on.  If you can afford it, always go with high grade leaves.\n",
      "I own this style in a more expensive pair. This one is good for the price. If the expensive ones were next to these, you could tell the difference, but on their own, in your ears, I think you'd get many compliments.

      "We always keep a box of this in the cupboard for when we have people at our house. It's got a nice coffee flavor without being too bold. It is a nice middle-of-the-road coffee for people that drink coffee a lot and those that don;t drink much at all.\n",
      "There wasn't anything special about this item. The fit was OK, the raider patch could have been adjusted to sit a little lower overall just OK\n",
      "I agree with the other reviewer these clickers are not very loud at all and I have trouble hearing it outsdide especially with cars going down my street. I have had some luck with it though, and for the price you get 3 so it's a good deal. Just wish they were louder.\n",

      "I have previously owned 5 toothbrushes but this one without a doubt was the worst. It was more noisy (with a wavering, disconcerting sound) and it was very inconsistent in recharging -- sometimes it completed in 8 to twelve hours; other times it was still charging after 24 hours. Then my wife took the fully charged unit on a trip, and it was fully discharged after one day's usage. It was only a year and a half old...\n",
      "I didn't think it was fair to give a low number of stars because this book was not for me. But this book was not for me.<br /><br />I listened to the audio sample, and the guy sounded just like my history teacher in my school.<br /><br />I was hoping to find a book to make history exciting, for me. Instead I found someone who is boring, just like my teacher. Maybe he makes good points, or different points than my teacher.<br /><br />But he's still boring. I hope this is not unfair. I'm sure it's a great book if you like boring things. I don't.\n",

      "I love this show honestly the best thing in TV right now! But when I bought the DVD I don't know if it was because its an older season but the quality wasn't the best. I wish I would have gotten the Blue-ray. I'm someone that appreciates the quality of film I'm watching  as well. It was a bit distracting but others may not be that critical. I rather get my other Modern Family DVD's in Blue-ray.\n",
      "It functions well, but is what it is; an inexpensive record player. Don't expect high-quality stereo sound; it sounds like a portable record player. It is what I had expected when ordering and am satisfied with the purchase.\n",
      "I find it to be as good as the main brand, the one everyone seems to look up to, and that cost more as well. We like this product very much and we decided to buy enough to last us until 2014, knowing that this product does age well, especially when sealed.\n",
      "This works perfectly. I like not having to fight with the thermometer under his arm. It was easy changing the measurement to Celsius. The temperature is very quick and seems accurate. Very happy with it.\n",

      "This is partly my fault since I printed the pictures off of an inkjet printer, but should the ink really just slider off like this? It's like splashing a perfect image on to the paper with paint. You don't expect it to stay as it is.\n",
      "The umbrella functions well and it does provide the shade I was looking for. I didn't like the stand as it was intrusive and would require an individual to walk around and avoid it. I bolted it into our cement patio. Had that not been done, an umbrella that sits in the center would have sufficed.\n",
      "I was horrified to see the recipes are pretty basic (designed for kindergarten kids) and doesn't' even have 1 picture. For example, the author Michael Matthews tells me how to make PEANUT BUTTER AND OATMEAL, do I really need to be taught how to mix peanut butter and oatmeal in a bowl? Put it in a microwave and eat it for breakfast? Unless I'm missing a brain cell, I think it's appalling to call this simple breakfast a recipe!! And very unhealthy to suggest I use a microwave to cook most of the meals!! Also there's lots of typing errors all over the place, as if it's been hastily copied and pasted. I had expected a lot more after reading all the positive reviews but I'm very disappointed, it seems you can't always trust what you see, if it looks too good to be true most of the time it isn't true. This is an okay book with average recipes nothing more than 1 or 2 stars.\n",
      "If you are looking for basic theft deterrance this is a great camera. It is easy enough to set up. This is not a really high end machine, and it is about as good as the price range it is in.\n",

      "These bluetooth headphones really made my day.When i first saw them,i definitely decided to try it on and test them out.The sound quality is just sooooooo awesome and so clear.I can hear anything when wearing these headphones! The bluetooth function is great and I haven't had a problem with it at all.Easy to understand guides and a high quality headphones which can be a great gift for anyone.I also tried these headphones on my Iphone and the sound quality was great there as well.Steady bluetooth connection and a great look.Definitely one of the best headphones I've ever had!There was a slight problem with charging but i hope it's fixed now.  ***UPDATE*** So after enjoying the sound quality for a couple of weeks I decided to take it on a trip... I packed it in the case it came with and after coming back home and unfolding the headsets the headpiece on the left just detached itself... Turns out this product is really flimsy so to be honest I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere... Seller tried to help but it was just a cold response with no viable solution. It was fun but it was short lived. Here are the pictures to determine what happened only after UNFOLDING this... Pathetic material\n",
      "Kim Sheridan has taken some time off from her school teaching job in a poor part of London to help her cousin out at the hotel she and her husband run, because her husband is in hospital. On the way she gets in a fender bender with non other than her ex-husband, Luke Savage, who, by coincidence, is staying at the hotel. They lapse into argument, because these are two people who truly seem to dislike each other. In fact, if two people never should have been married, well these are them.<br /><br />At the hotel, Kim discovers Luke is a writer, you think she would have known this, and that he is hiding out here to work. Then Kim's cousin is required at the hospital to be at her husband's bedside for a few days and now Kim is running the hotel by herself. She doesn't anticipate any problem, after all, there aren't too many guests. Then two of the staff come down with food poisoning and now she's in trouble. Then the ex she can't stand offers to pitch in and help and for a few pages there we think maybe he's not such a bad guy. Then more guests, friends of Luke's, show up and the books really takes off.<br /><br />I'll admit that at first I didn't think I was going to like this book. Luke is one of those self-assured, kiss 'em and they swoon kind of men that some romance writers like to write about, but that I don't like to read about, but he has character and lots of good qualities and that pulled the book up a lot in my estimation. A very nice and enjoyable read.\n",

      "I love this hamper. It's a very nice hamper for a nursery. It is on the small side and it is a bit dainty. I have one in each teenager's room and after 3 days the hamper is filled. They bottom is small and the top is wide.\n",
      "We put this in our RV to replace the hide-a-bed couch that takes up to much room (when used as a bed). How well it actually works will be up to our 12 year old granddaughter. Since she can sleep most anywhere the next revue should be good.\n",

      "Compared to the other labels from other printers, this one is cheaper on per-label. So far, we haven't had any label mis-feed or labels getting caught in the printer. That is over 3 years of usage in a busy medical office, going through about 2-3 boxes of labels per month.\n",
      "This rug was ordered for a nursery, and it feels great underfoot, either with shoes or barefooted.

      "Honestly I had high hoped for this product but it disappointed me. I got it from the Supercuts promo for free, and my barber said it would work on my thinning hair. Well it did actually work, but it took over 6 months for me to see results! You're better off chopping off all your hair, unless you have a ton of patience. Also a negative is how high the price is for this product. At the mall they're selling it for over $70 PER BOTTLE. This is just far too high. The sales lady was nice enough, very attractive and convincing in trying to buy it but I'm not going to give up $70 just because she smiles at me. Anyway, that's my 2 cents.\n",

      "When I bought the black leggings I thought they were okay, they didn't fit as comfortably as I would of wanted. But since I paid premium for these leggings, I thought I would give it a shot. So I went to the Gym in them and every single guy and girl kept telling me that these the portion in the back were way too transparent and were able to see through. I have to admit that I do not like to wear underwear when I use leggings, so you can imagine what was the reaction.<br /><br />I felt so embarrassed, these leggings are are revealing in the back, since I couldn't tell from the front much.

      "Lead contamination of matcha is a real problem in China! I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.<br />I think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a \"Product of China”. It is an important issue. Once I have seen the lab report on Amazon I will write what I thought about the appearance and taste of this matcha.<br /><br />It is useful to read \"SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA” and the Consumer Lab dot com article which you can find online. They are a real eye-opener!\n",

      "Overall, I think this is a cool product.  I had a lot of fun using it but it was bulky and hard to hold.  Maybe I have tiny hands.  My son wanted to use this so I let him try.  He's 11 and he really wasn't able to do much with it since he had to hold it with two hands but he had fun trying which is what is most important.  I wish this was rechargable so there wasn't a cord.  I did make some fun little things and after about 20 minutes I got the hang of it and it made it easier.  I will be buying more plastic for it because I do like it a lot and think that with some practice I will be able to make some pretty cool things.  There are just some design issues I wish could be addressed which is why I gave it three stars.\n",
      "This seems cruel but with the scare of dengue I had to do something. No chemicals that can harm me or my pet. Scares me every time it zaps but works well.

If you took the time to read the measurements and actually measure the space in the room before buying it you will know what you are getting. I got this for my preteen-teen and he loves it. There is a LOT of storage in it. It will take several HOURS to put together and you need 2 people for some of it. Some of the material is less than stellar but for the price I was not expecting high quality wood. Only appropriate for older kids or teens. An adult would not appreciate having to climb into it at night.\n",

      "So first off, it is a lot darker than the picture, for us that was OK because we wanted something not that light, and by reading that review it was sold for us! The fact that it was so cheap, so big, and had non skid backing, we were sold. When it got here it was so much better in person! Beautiful, beautiful, it does feel a little cheap, but we don't care about that. After all it just goes under the dining room table to save our new floors. It's so perfect. 100%%% in love.\n",
      "Wallet is made of good quality materials, but the slots for credit cards are just barely wide enough, which may put a lot of stress on the leather and stitching as credit cards are taken in and out. I'm concerned about how well the wallet will stand up to normal use. We'll see.\n",
      "This product has palm oil in it, and as far as \"vegetable\" oils are concerned its one of the worst oils around. Yes, I suppose the palm oil is natural, but it's a saturated fat and it's NOT healthy. It also has added sugar. Other brands might be a better choice for health conscious consumers as it has only two ingredients, peanuts and salt.\n",
      "I used this kit with two vivitar flashes and it works great. I got another of the trigger kits to set up a third flash to get some extra light when I have a bigger photo-shot. Light stands were fairly heavy duty and I should be able to use them with my other mono lights. The triggers worked almost every time. I didn't use any sync cords, just mounted the transmitter on my camera and was all set to go. Took me less than 15 minutes to get everything out of the box, setup and start taking pictures.\n",
      "I guess I should have read the negative reviews more carefully because this stylus results you get from this stylus are pretty poor for the high price they charge.<br /><br />The pen has several faults starting with where the power button is located. I had to constantly try and rotate the pen so I wouldn't hit the power button.  Very annoying<br /><br />Next the so called worlds best stylus couldn't even capture my signature any better than my cheap 5 dollar griffin stylus.<br /><br />I honestly feel like I was ripped off<br /><br />Ok so then I gave the stylus to my friend who is a professional graphic artist to test it and see if it was just me that was having issues.  After 10 minutes of use she told me this was not worth the money I spent and directed me to buy something different.<br /><br />I can say that this stylus does NOT take notes very well and you spend more time trying to correct the poor results than just trumping a note or using a cheapie stylus<br /><br />I've decided that my 5 dollar griffin will do better than this 70 dollar toy<br /><br />My search continues for a good active stylus<br /><br />Trust me and avoid this at all costs\n",
      "I didn't had any problems with this router, since I read all the positive reviews and decided to buy one for my newly purchased laptop. The problem started after my second firmware update. In the beginning everything was normal but after the update, router would constantly lose signal. Now, every 2 minutes my wifi disconnects for no apparent reason - and this didn't happened before, so I called support but they told me to reset the router, which I did, but problem continued. Luckily, I had a warranty so I returned the router.<br /><br />On my friend's recommendation, and he works at local internet service provider, I bought AC1759 Router ( http://amzn.to/13FE6I1 ), which didn't had any problem. I updated the last firmware and I didn't noticed a big change, so as long as it's working normally, I'm glad :).\n",

      "Bought the unit brand new during power outage to run my pellet stove and a light or two. Would just stop for no apparent reason. But after much fussing got it to run consistently, which it did for about another 6 hours then stopped permanently. There is no compression when I pull the starter cord, so I am assuming the rings or valves are shot.\n",

After I saw that this one was one of the bestselling here and that it had mostly positive reviews, I decided to buy one. After I received it I spotted bent neck and spotty craftsmanship. But the worst thing happened when I tried to play it. The sound was awful, and the strings were too stretched - definitely not my recommendation :/.    My friend, who's a violin player in orchestra, bought a Cecilio violin ( http://amzn.to/1xAJ6IL ), a week ago from Amazon and it was far more better than this one, Sound is better, and the craftsmanship is perfect, I just ordered the same :).\n",

I got a couple bottles of this as a trial at a hotel.  Lather Bamboo Creme Hair Wash.  This stuff is AWFUL!!  As soon as I put it on my head and try to rub it in, my hair becomes a ratty mess!!  I don't know if it's because my hair is color treated, but this is unbelievable.  There should be a warning.  I spent 45 minutes brushing the rats out of my hair and had a very sore head for almost 2 days.  I don't know if these people bottled the stuff incorrectly, if hair wash means it's not shampoo and I am not supposed to rub my head or what, but I will NEVER buy this stuff and I will RUN from any hotel that offers it!!\n",

      "I bought these pail refill bags to go with my pail and I am really happy with them.  I bought the system before I had my baby boy, a couple of months ago, and I am not unhappy with either the pail or these bags.<br /><br />At the moment, my baby's diapers are very small and therefore, the bags do hold 25 diapers, quite easily.  However, I should imagine that as his diapers get bigger, the bags will hold less of them.  At the moment, it is a bit of a squeeze to get the bags out of the pail, but they never break.  They snap shut really easily and firmly, ensuring any smells are kept inside - which is ALWAYS a good thing with diapers.  I am very satisfied with these.\n",
      "A lot smaller that I imagined. The picture looks great and it does look ok but I am not using it for what I intended. I wanted to use as a lounge chair but the back is too low and it's not long enough for someone 5'8&#34;. I would say if you are about 5'3&#34; it would work for you. Look at the measurements before making a purchase. I set it up after the 30 days so I had to make use of it. Nice to have the storage and I can sit in it for a bit just not to lounge for too long.\n",

The arm rest are pretty smooth too.  The chair itself is soft and pretty thick so it must be of a high quality. So far everything is good except for the wheels, I put on some oil into it since it makes this squeeze sound whenever I move.\n",

      "I have asked my friend to buy this gadget for me as my PC broke down 1 mth ago. My shower room always have a mushy smell which I can't get rid of. After reading so many reviews that are obviously not from genuine buyers ( now I know), I bought one and try. It is junk ! Have got my friend to get a refund for me.\n",

      "Dear Doc Martin(s),<br /><br />My cousin Tuesday, who totally knows every super, fabulous being in Manhattan, drew a blank (literally on paper) when I mentioned your name. Hmm. I cannot bear to live with or without a mystery. I dispatched my brother Blake straightaway to the Astor estate and or compound on Long Island. After he left, I was hit with a worrisome thought; are the Astors still alive?! Another mystery I had to bear. An eternity passed and finally my brother phoned. Yes, the Astors were still among the mortal and hell no, you Doctor Wednesday, are not part of their reality.<br /><br />What I can tell you is this Miss Doctor Person; Wednesdays are for the middle of the week and &#34;Addams Family&#34; films.<br /><br />Yours Amid the Whirl,<br /><br />Christopher Roberts\n",
      "Time is gold, finally bought this one last week. An affordable watch for men that look simple but have a good quality! It is just better than any other watch out there.\n",
      "Pendrive is very good, It is compatible with all Android OS. Read and write speed is also remarkable.<br />But one problem with this pendrive is , it is heated up very much withing first usage means upto 7-8 days. but after, its all ok..\n",
      "im not a big fan of this product. while it does moisturize well the smell is not that great. i will use when i have very dry skin as it does help alot. but like i said the smell isnt that great at all.\n",
      "This product is okay.<br />The price is all right.<br />I only use this every party such as birthdays, weddings, baptismal, etc.\n",
      "The biggest problem was, once I received lighting bulb pack, the thing that to remove a single bulb, you must remove all bulbs by resetting the hue bridge to factory default & building the system from the ground up. I had to call a repairman to do this, and when he saw what I bought he laughed at me. He wondered how I got Ethernet cable and in here it said wireless, so I had to put on other wall plug, which was hard, due to &#34;modern&#34; look of my house. Android app is also not helpful, it updates every hour or so and it really ruins the whole process, because I cannot stand by my mobile every time.<br /><br />Nevertheless, my friend who was lightning designer, said that I needed to buy a Phillips 2599 ( http://amzn.to/1wBs8pI ), because its completely wireless and it's easier to install it, he also bought a pack of them, a month ago and said he'll order more because of their quality.\n",
      "This is an amazing bracelet. I wore it for the first time today and received so many compliments. Several gals wanted to try it on. It is well made and is much prettier than the picture. I wish there were earrings to match.\n",
      "So far so good, although I'm not too confident with the build, its working perfectly in the driveway soaking up sun and lighting up a blind spot for when I use the car. Great price too.\n",
      "Great way to count burned calories, I use it with my Ipod since I dont want t bring my iphone when doing runs. The price is just a little steep though considering its disposable.\n",
      "I get this only for me because I can't exactly let my kids have some of this, can I? So now I have my own hidden treat for myself and the kids have their gummy bears and sour patches to keep them entertained.\n",
      "This is awesome cover for my lappy. It looks so cool. Only one thing you need to take care while sticking it on your laptop or do it with any experienced person otherwise it will left with bubble.\n",
      "I have some bubbles on the edges but my main concern is that there are huge sections on top and bottom that didn't adhere to the screen.\n",
      "I love the syrup, but this brand of yacon syrup dried out like, midway through the bottle. Super annoying. I'd purchase a different, higher quality brand.\n",
      "Plenty of slots for credit and other cards and room for cash and other necessities. A very nice looking wallet that is more than functional. For those who wear a suit or sport coat, this item should be considered. It will, however, stick out of most pants pockets, so not recommended for those who do not intend to use it in a jacket pocket.\n",
      "This wax is great!<br /><br />It holds strong but you can still style it throughout the day. It doesn't leave the white flakes like hairspray does.\n",
      "Works as advertised but i hope that it came in different sizes for various windows. Good thing is that it can also be used in the car, when it gets too hot.\n",
      "I thought it didn't work with 6.1/7.1 cards as he indicated. I contacted the Buttkicker tech support folks and they informed me that is not true and said you need to turn on the \"low frequency redirect\" in your soundcard settings.\n",

      "Pros: Concept of a case with an attachable strap to work as an armband. That's really about it.<br />Cons: Silicone material does not work well for work outs or running, except maybe very light workouts. It sticks to the arm with no flexibility to allow free movement of the arm. I usually run 3-4 miles followed by 25 minutes of strength training. This armband was painful to wear for more than a mile. When I removed it after the run, the skin is flaming red in that spot.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I think a more flexible material that doesn't cause so much friction would be better suited for this design. This material in itself is too painful to wear.\n",
      "Very comfortable. Lots of padding. Plenty of room. Also this car-seat has the side impact for extra protection for your child. Really easy to adjust for the perfect fit. Great value.\n",
      "Definitely recommend this chair to anyone who wants to have a great look to their house and be comfortable. Exactly as described with this product.\n",
      "This crib is beautiful. I also ordered the bedding shown in this crib. It looks awesome together! My husband and father put it together and it only took about 15 minutes. Everything I have ever ordered from them is always damaged in some way. So beware.\n",
      "This purchase is good, I am quite impressed with the quality because I've tried a couple of resistance bands before which lasted for a month, these bands are tough and has very impressive quality considering the price. I recommend this brand.\n",

      "Took 2 days to get to me & when it arrived, I was eagerly waiting to see it work. Had an older model and this was the right time to see that I had advanced and gotten another one which could help in the charging process. My new model has worked way better than the old one which used to overheat thanks for the in-built fan\n",
      "you hold the switch back and press it down at the same time, or bang it against the wall it will brighten up, but once you bend it back over and go back to trying to read, it dims to the point of being useless.\n",
      "The book was fantastic. But I would rate the movie with just an 'okay'. Let me tell you why. It fails in delivering the emotions that you could feel when reading the book. The characters in this movie are crafted after the nowadays heroes theme. And that's too commercial for my tastes. Indeed, the film delivers excelent entertainment and the effects are very realistic. It's a good movie, but the book is better.\n",
      "It is a nice watch. I had to have 2 links removed so it would fit my wrist. I am slightly disappointed, as the face of the watch is larger than I anticipated (or wanted). Another review compared it to the size of a quarter and it is definitely larger than a quarter.\n",
      "My friend bought for her dog gloria she didn't like it at all. I asked if I could have it and it doesn't bother my max. Only thing is after washed doesn't look new and a little bally\n",

      "This is a good adaptor and it does not compromise volume at all. It does not have any ticks or issues that I have yet to notice. I am very pleased with the performance.\n",
      "Well made keyboard...<br /><br />Getting the keys off to clean or replace is a nightmare.  I had to open one of these to fix a spill on a friends and about 4 of them broke.  Not on the X lifter but on the KEY itself....  the Snap-in part is made of such thin and brittle plastic you better hope you never have to take them off.<br /><br />The saving grace?<br /><br />If someone breaks with it and you are still in the warranty period Logitech will send you a new one.  Totally free!  They do not even ask for you to return the broken one.... Mainly because of what I saw when i disassembled it,  The membrane is unrepairable if opened up to clean circuit leads.\n",
      "I am a small woman with small ears so, the size of these earrings was perfect for me. They were beautiful and dainty. The color is exactly what I was going for (although the color of the pearl on the earrings was different than on the necklace). The problem was these earrings were so flimsy that they started to bend upon opening the lever-back. Not good. I was afraid I might rip my earring hole trying to get these off. If they weren't so malleable, they would be awesome.\n",
      "One of my Christmas gifts, was pretty excited to use it with my iPod Touch, since it was collecting dust after getting an iPad. Followed the directions, downloaded the app, hooked the controller up to my iPod, batteries in, brand new, placed it in the middle of the living room, ready to go and BANG! NOTHING! Contacted Griffin direct, turned out to be a bad remote, wasn't transmitting signals, after a half hour on the phone, they said they would send another one, they did, pooped in on the iPod, and this time, it transmitted signals, now what signals it was transmitting I have no idea, it was so faulty and clumsy even my wife was laughing. Would give zero stars if I could.\n",
      "The set up was easy- the printer has great quality- so far so good!! Great price! A little noisy when printing but the quality of print makes up for it. Happy with this product- just replaced another brands' printer and glad I did!\n",
      "My three month old grandson loves his bath time so much in this bath tub. His parents place it in the kitchen sink where he enjoys looking out the window while splashing & kicking in his very own jacuzzi.\n",
      "Great sturdy pockets. Great for all your needs. I know most people will wish to have deeper pockets but from the design you can't really add deep pockets or else the entire item would hang much too low on the back of the seat.\n",
      "This is actually a good product to have, though I wouldn't say that it's the best. If I have one complaint about it, it's the fact that it's plastic which makes me nervous.\n",
      "Just recieved it today. Shipped to me fast..received it in just a little over a week from placing the order...took 3hrs to put together. It was tough. To tired to try it out tonight but after all this hard work and back ache...it better be worth it!!!\n",
      "I love this stabilizer! I have had it only about 2 days but have been running all over the place taking test videos.<br />Pros:<br />- Cheap, its got to be the cheapest one I found<br />- Quality seems good<br />- Its really light and didn't hurt my wrist as I was running around<br />Cons:<br />- Cant really think of any right now, but will update my review if need be after I've had this longer.\n",
      "These would have been great except for too much static on both phones. I couldn't hear the other end because of the static. But they can hear me well.\n",
      "these are great, but the rubber covering the dumbbells are a little rough and uncomfortable to hold. the stand is not sturdy and pretty useless, as well.\n",
      "Easy of operation,storage of bits is very innovative, you can adjust the driving force/torque to some extent....overall very user friendly...\n",
      "This bag's handles are non-existent. They are so short you cannot get your hand underneath them to get into the bag. I loved the look of the bag online but found it could only be worn as a shoulder bag.\n",
      "Very disappointed at how quickly this tarnishes and gets a greenish tint where the water goes. I do not have hard water and none of my other fixtures have this problem.\n",
      "I bought this for my 9year old cousin. It was a great success! He played with it for a little over 1 hour on the first charge. Re-charged which took about 3 hours and went for another hour.<br /><br />He was using it in the driveway, it went over the street curb many times. The battery did not fall out like many of his other cars do.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because the top speed seemed to max out at 10MPH.\n",
      "Sorry, I got a tape where the first few inches tries were just dry.  Then it got better further along.  Just be careful. you might not get what you wanted with this.\n",
      "I love gummi bears and Haribo is just the best! I use it for sugar rush while mountain climbing...or doing any other strenuous activity. I love the taste and the gumminess is incomparable!!!\n",
      "Using this projector is so frustrating that I actually screamed a little during a staff meeting. We were supposed to be doing a presentation, but after the images just could not be shown in any clear manner, we just gave up on it altogether.\n",
      "This bear is so soft and cuddly! perfect newborn baby gift or for a young child. something they will be able to hug and love unlike some of those stiff stuffed animals out there.\n",
      "I take the bus everywhere I go, and a backpack is absolutely necessary. I have a few different backpacks I switch out every now and then, and this is one of them. I think it's a great little pack, honestly. It looks great, for one, and is made with good, sturdy materials that are able to stand up to a lot of use. The zippers are especially nice, very high quality. I can carry it or wear it, and either way it's highly functional. Lots of space inside, too. It didn't smell great when I first got it, though, like a very strong kind of fake smell, but it dissipated after a few hours being out of the shipping material. Weird, but I didn't let it deter me. Still works, and I really like it.\n",
      "For culinary quality, it is not bad. I would not consider it ceremonial quality however, but that is not what is advertised. It is a tad bit expensive though.\n",
      "This is a great nabber. It is very sturdy and It picks up well but the grip handle hurts your hand after a while. In general, I am pleased with the grabber.\n",
      "Our kids loved watching movies on long drives. It was much less expensive than a built-in system, too. We bought, just 8 months later, it broke. The latch that keeps the DVD player closed would pop open when we drove over bumps.\n",
      "You get what you pay for.  It's limited in the tilt feature, but that was not a prerequisite going in for me. It does the job but the fan is weak, can't satisfy me with the air it blows.\n",
      "As usual, I was excited to use this router in my three story house and get a full signal at all times. Although, that couldn't be further from what happened... This thing dropped signal so often, I couldn't get anything done!<br /><br />This was so hard for me, after spending so much money and to be worse off than I was before.<br /><br />After I dealt with returning this router and researching as much as possible I found a GREAT router that hasn't given me a single issue in any way.<br /><br />If you want to take a look, it is here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/1hQmOP7<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the router for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one.\n",
      "For the money, this is a good scope. Has good eye relief, but does have parrelex. Lenses are slightly cloudy on the inside. It is good enough for my 22mag Marlin, but I don't think I would use it on anything high power.\n",
      "Super cheap looking in person. Bad quality fabric. Nothing I liked about this at all.The apron size is very small, for the children but not for the adults.\n",
      "This was provided by a workshop aimed at improving student learning, but it only led to frustration on the part of the students as well as the educators that participated. The quality was simply awful.\n",
      "It never made sense to me that a driver needed to cost $300. You're just whacking something hard for distance. This cheap driver with its big head is perfect for someone new to the game and not deadly serious. I only picked up playing golf in the last years and still don't want to commit my children's inheritance to the past time. If you're looking for a good hard hitting driver and don't want to spend a small fortune, this is the one.\n",
      "I'm not sure what everyone is all crying about, but my bibs look exactly like the pic! They seem good quality too. I didn't give it 5 stars because I haven't used them and my baby is not here yet. I will soon.\n",
      "The fit is good and comes just slightly below his waste . Although the cost was very reasonable, this vest is top quality.this product is very Good realy like this vest it is my favorite.\n",
      "I'm sorry I REALLY tried to like this thing but it was a little noisy to begin with but I like the extra charging ports.... It has been slowly dying since we hooked it up.  Now the fan doesn't work at all.  I would not purchase again.\n",
      "Arrived late, to my dismay, so I re-scheduled my appointment. Took it to the blue and yellow big box store along with the pioneer deck and was advised by the stereo manager it is not allowed (for legal reasons i don't want to elaborate on) to have installed in TN and I was asked to take it home with me by the blue and yellow big box store car stereo manager. They made sure I would not slip it to anyone in the bay... Waiting on seller for a month now to send me a call tag for the return and my refund.\n",
      "If you aren't as advanced and just want a solid wireless signal for the money, this is the one to get.\n",
      "Use this product and never make a mistake with your measurements unless you have extremely poor eyesight. If so, get it checked.\n",
      "I really love this scarf. I received this on my birthday and I am very happy to have this one. I like the texture and its design.\n",
      "As I am eating daily these candies (even though they might have a lot of sugar and I am risking my diet), because they taste great. However, I found lower prices in other places.\n",
      "I have ordered these brushes around April and it came very late and the brush looked to cheap and 2 of them were broken it was disappointed for me and my customers\n",
      "Made out of cheap plastic material that feels will rip very easily, but then again you get what you pay for. I just needed something cool for my 6 year old to sit on while playing xbox or watching tv coz he always sat on the floor coz the couch was too far. All in all it works out fine, just wish they were made a little more tough.\n",
      "Bought these thinking they would be good to eat and help me with my diet and all but I was wrong.  They don't taste good to me at all.  I actually put hot sauce on as I ate them.\n",
      "Ordered these as gifts. They fit properly, i.e. sufficient depth to crown. Sizing is just a little smaller than the Panama hats we own. Seems like a good value, only time will tell.\n",
      "In my opinion this is a good start to a system.<br /><br />This is fine for a bedroom or smaller sized living area. This will not replace your surround sound system. The wattage rating and speaker size reinforces this point. That being said, the quality of the tower is up to par.<br /><br />* Quality enclosure<br />* No assembly required<br />* iPod mates to tower<br />* Remote mates to iPod<br />* Secure line Jacks<br />* MP3 Aux-in Jack<br />* FM radio with 20 preset<br />* Composite video output<br /><br />These are all good working features and those without functional glitches.<br /><br />An area that could be improved:<br /><br />AM stations seem to be non-existent. Perhaps FM stations are only received.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The tower is priced well and the quality of the audio is very good. We purchased the tower for our sons room and in that space the tower works well.\n",
      "This product is so cheaply made it is unbelievable. The sound quality is terrible. When you insert a cassette be careful not to bend the pin that sticks out inside of the unit that fasten in the cassette. The radio will not even begin to pick up weak stations. My wife wants to keep it because it is portable.\n",
      "This pen is exceptional for the price. Smooth writing, nib glides over paper, ink flow is perfect. This is my new favorite pen. The only complaint - The box it comes in is some cheap plastic thing.\n",
      "These doormats do take the dirt off your shoes, but don't try to step on them with bare feet. I often go out on to my front porch in bare feet and the first time I stepped on this mat, yikes! If you plan to be in bare feet I suggest another type of mat. Otherwise, very functional although not really attractive. I think I'll limit to the back porch!\n",
      "Took the poles out for the first time this Saturday and already one of the poles has broken. They are cheap and cheaply made, will be returned Monday morning for something of better quality.\n",
      "I could barely tolerate the taste and texture of these wraps and I'm usually a very tolerant person who can eat anything. Once, I ate an entire plate of pasta that was both burned and uncooked. I could not figure out how that happened, even now.\n",
      "My daughter had a problem getting my grandson to eat his veggies. At one of his checkups the doctor did a blood test. We were told his iron was low, because lack of veggies in his diet. I bought her some of the food products, he just loved them.\n",
      "This was a pretty far-fetched piece of work, and that's putting it mildly. If I look at it as a form of entertainment, I supposed it works. But I have a feeling that that's not what the author intended.\n",
      "My husband has long, thin fingers on delicate, lean hands. This makes the gloves a little too large for him even though the size was supposed to be right. That was my mistake though.\n",
      "This unit is doing its job, in terms of navigation. It gets GPS signal (not very fast, but it gets...) and it does not have huge location errors. It looks good and the remote control is also very handy. Unfortunately, the maps updating process is almost impossible.\n",
      "They do not require huge force to work perfectly. They don't splatter mouse guts all over the place or make a bloody mouse mess. Also, they don't really hurt if they release on your finger (hard to do since you're finger is never in the trap). They grab and suffocate the mouse. Awesome design, works terrific, an ant could set it off and it's practically impossible for mice to raid the bait without triggering the trap so even tiny mice get got.\n",
      "This car charger is definitely on the cheap side. It feels very \"plasticy\" and is extremely light and unattractive..<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />It does work, at least it has worked so far for the last few weeks as I use it daily on my commute to work and back.<br /><br />I bought another, more expensive charger for my husband (he has an iPhone 4S) and it just seems more reliable, especially when plugging it in and pulling it out.<br /><br />Other reviewers have had some very bad experiences with this product so if you want to roll the dice and try your luck, give this charger a go. For a few bucks, even if it breaks, it's not the end of the world...<br /><br />My recommendation is to pay a little more and get a better quality Apple iPhone charger.\n",
      "I am very disappointed by this case. I waste good money down the drain. I should have done some deep research in finding the case for my phone.\n",
      "Terrific value. My husband just wishes that these jeans came in a 35&#34; waist which would then make them a perfect fit!\n",
      "It must be my perspective. I love the glasses Joan wears and when I saw the &#34;oversized&#34; offer I thought just what I want. Not. I have the &#34;regular&#34; Joan glasses and the oversize were not as big as I would have liked. I can go spin the sun glass carousel at my upscale clothing store and find bigger. I will keep them because I like the style.\n",
      "It is great outside by the pool. If forget to bring it in, it's ok cause it will not hurt the speaker.\n",
      "It was too hard for my 11 week old puppy. She check it out, mouthed it and never touched it again. Maybe when she gets larger\n",
      "I am in love with this watch! It is heavy and bigger than I thought it would be but I am not disappointed at all. I have received exceptional reviews from my peers about this watch. I refuse to tell them where I got it b/c I am greedy that way.\n",
      "I found that it is great on toasted gluten free bread. Also I can use it in recipes by substituting it for sugar. I love the easy cap it is so CUTE!! And it is well shipped without any damage.\n",
      "Adds some effect to the photo if you use this during a photo shoot. When I zoom it out until 18mm the edges of the hood can be seen, so I just avoid zooming it out to the extremes but I can deal with it.\n",
      "I personally feel that Lord of the Ring is better than this, but overall this movie is good. I know what happened before Lord of the Ring such as how they get the ring and also the elven blade. Still, I like the best is....PRECIOUS!!!!\n",
      "This is a real simple game and ur friends are gonna make fun of you when you get it out. Cause it looks like something kids would play. But then get a few drinks in ya and everybody takes it all serious. Great game really.\n",
      "Product is very nice and good looking. Only thing is once it was put together we notice a handle on it was broken. But overall good. Maybethey can contact us to fix this problem.\n",
      "It arrived way before the estimated delivery date, which is awesome. The quality is very good, it's really worth the price.\n",
      "They are good products and put out the amount of light I expected. On sale, the price was very good, which I why I leaped. But you always have to look at how long it will take you to recoup the money you spent on the bulb vs the amount of electricity you saved.\n",
      "I thought it would be more of an accent, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was bright enough to light up the whole room. The \"paper\" shading does soften the light though making it easy to function without a glare. It takes the tiny E12 bulbs (three of them). Another nice feature is the on/off foot switch. It was incredibly easy to assemble (i think it took me a grand total of two minutes to put it together and plug it in).\n",
      "For an advanced book, it's difficult to read and understand. I found numerous mistakes and errors. The structure of the book is poor and lacks in-depth information on using advanced features and tools.\n",
      "I bought this for my nephew, it looks okay to me. It functions well and it's very cute in actual. Great product!\n",
      "These shoes are fantastic!!! They are exactly what we were looking for. Excellent price, excellent value!!! So comfortable and great fit.\n",
      "Great for all babies! Including those with respiratory and colic problems! Magic wonder! We Love it! Should have for the baby. One of the good sleeper for babies from the fisher price.\n",
      "It's not very engaging for my son. We have a notepad of lined paper from the dollar store, and I can write letters for him to trace just as easily.\n",
      "Bought this a month ago to replace my ageing HP deskjet all in one. It has all the features you'd expect in a modern all in one.\n",
      "It provided extended life for a few days only. After that it functions about the same as the stock battery. A waste of money.\n",
      "Broke within a week. Very disappointing . Went to best buy and got a new one . Sorry cant rate it more then 2 star !\n",
      "I mounted this on a ruger 10/22 and it works great! The only thing I had to do was shim (piece of cardboard) the rear scope ring because it shot a little high even after using all the elevation adjustment.\n",
      "The case is a little bulky but does an amazing job of protecting my phone. I forgot my iPhone on the roof of my car and drove off.

      "This movie is almost two and a half hours long. All-in-all it is a fun take on the old tale. (no new plot here, save for the in depth look at Tonto's past) Some Texas Rangers get ambushed and only one survives, leaving a Lone Ranger. A dead brother who's wife loved them both at one point, gives us a great damsel, add her impressionable son, a corrupt train mogul, a scary outlaw who eats parts of his victims, and a pair of hero's that carry the film with their antics, and you've got a good western romp. Depp plays a great Tonto, especially, the old Tonto that starts the flick.  My only negative is this: Two hours of  s - l - o - w  build up for thirty minutes of over the top climax is not that great of a ratio for a film. Thirty minutes of it could have been edited out and the thing would have been perfect.  4 stars, A \"Must See\" for fans of westerns, Depp, and The Lone Ranger. - MR\n",

I ordered this here off amazon and not only does it smell different then the stuff I had before, but its made my hair shed like crazy. I returned it asap and had a long talk with an amazon representative. Unfortunately without more complaints, they won't look into if this is a fake product or not. Save yourself the trouble...\n",

      "I had high hopes for this movie. Winona Ryder's in it, after all. But those hopes were quickly dashed once I got into this corny and very stupid movie. Our hero, a rather studly guy played by Simon Baker, gets an e-mail with the names of all the girls he's been to bed with and all the ones he is going to bed. However, he's just about to tie the knot. Now if you were a stud would you get married, if you all of a sudden knew you were going to bed a gaggle of gals in the very near future?<br /><br />Winona plays Death Nell, a goth girl who goes around putting guys to sleep. She give them a potion and they go into a coma. Well, she inadvertently kills one. Naturally she's the last girl on the list and Mr. Stud doesn't want to go there, but can he help himself, can he quit taking good looking hotties to bed, even if he wants to? That is the question and that question is so silly that you might want to give this movie a pass. Still, it didn't suck, so if you're in the video store and can't decide what to get, Winona Ryder is in the movie and that has to account for something.\n",

      "I have extensively used this unit for about 10 days now. I highly recommend it. The interface is different than the other device and takes some getting used to. Fortunately my brother has had the same unit with a smaller hdd for over a year and he shortened my learning curve.\n",

      "I got this video camera to record some of our performances, but the music was just crazy bad. I couldn't hear a note worth selling and it just whizzed out in some places. The quality of the vid wasn't bad. But if it can't catch music like I need it to then it's worthless to me.\n",

      "My daughter  is very independent when it comes to eating and would always grab my fork when I put food on her plate. I realized that he needed her own, but our forks are a bit too sharp for her to use while he's learning. The prongs help him pick up her food and they all lay flat so nothing falls off. The handle makes it really easy for her to hold too.\n",
      "I understand not getting great balls for this price, but the balls I received were yellowish and peeling. I have bought recycled balls before but these are not even worth the effort to hit. Picture shows balls with at least a decent amount of fair balls. Not even close to the worthless ones I received.\n",

Adata brand, put one in my camera took photos only to be so disappointed in the quality, bottom half of photos were missing, colored lines through all the photos that did actually take. Thought maybe it was just one bad one, but tried all 5 and none of them work properly. I even tried them in other electronic devices I have and none of them worked in anything. Big waste of my time waiting a week to get them and then they do not work. Don't waste your money like I did.\n",

      "The Perfect Fitness Ab Carver Pro was the first piece of equipment I purchased when I decided to create a home gym.  Along with this, a jump rope, and a waist trimmer belt, I lost 70 pounds over the past 7 months.  If you are just starting out, I'd recommend it be the first piece of equipment you get as well because it allows you to focus on the most important part of the body, THE CORE, which you should focus on first especially when you are just getting started or back into a workout routine.<br />I am not what you would call a bargain shopper (more like an impulse buyer ha) because if I were, I would have realized that you can get this same brand, and same model at Walmart for 10 dollars less than what it is selling for on amazon which is currently $39.95.  The Ab-Carver Pro is available on the Walmart web site right now for $29.77, so with the added tax (how does Amazon get away with not charging tax btw), you'll still save a fist full of dollars.<br /><br />If that is still too steep for you, and I totally understand if it is - still a lot of money to spend on a couple pieces of plastic, the best priced ab wheel I found on here appears to be this one for only $7.00 - [[ASIN:B00J0F3DR8 Wacces Ab Power Wheel Ab Roller]].  So, that is a good price, a great price actually.  Now you are probably asking yourself if you can get an ab wheel for such a ridiculously low price and it will do the job, then why on earth would you spend almost six times that amount and get the Ab Carver Pro!?<br /><br />While I think it may be overpriced, there are TWO key features on the Ab Carver Pro which make me not regret the purchase.  I only regret not getting it at Walmart lol.<br /><br />Key Feature #1:  The Wheel size is very very wide.  This makes a huge difference especially in the beginning.  The wider wheel provides more stability and the increased stability gives room for a greater range of motion which means more muscles are being contracted during the movement.  This translates into getting and seeing results a lot quicker.  When I first started, I highly doubt I could have even completed one full rep on a classic ab wheel but on this I was able to do sets of 6-7 full reps from day one.<br /><br />TIP FOR BEGINNERS:  Start on a wall, no kidding.  Lean into the wall at about 45% angle and start with higher reps of 15 up to 30.  Once you can do three full sets of 30 reps take it to the mat (or the knee pads they provide which I don't use personally)!<br /><br />Key Feature #2:  The Contoured handles really help with different angles.  Thr great thing about not being in the gym is I'm not stuck in those ab machines which force you to move in one range of motion over and over again hitting the same muscle fibers the same way, every time.  The handles it easy to hit every angle of your ab and core by moving in slightly different directions with each repettiton. With the Ab Carver, you can literally move in 20 different angles and better still, it doesn't bother my wrists either (like typing this review does for example!).<br /><br />The only other two pieces of equipment I have used and still use in my \"home gym\" are, as I mentioned earlier, a jump rope and a waist trimmer belt.<br /><br />I went through a couple jump ropes before landing on this one;  [[ASIN:B00GGKPCPG Buy Jump Ropes Double Unders Jump Rope]].  My biggest tip here is to make sure you get one that is adjustable in length like this one.  If its too long you're not going to be able to pick up enough speed when you get good at it for it to be effective and if its too short, then your going to have painful welts on your forehead and on the top of your head for a while!<br /><br />I went through more than a couple waist trimmers belts unfortunately until I found the one I own now.  Many of these belts are, to be frank; crap.  They are thrown together without much effort and after you sweat in it a few times, it starts to fall apart.  I've been using the one I have now for the past 6 months, so as hard as it is to do, I think this particular belt actually changed my mind about ab trimming belts in general.  I always wear this during my cardio (i.e. running outside) and especially when I use the jump ropes.  I would not suggest wearing one while you are using the Ab Carver but for cardio and jumping rope this thing will make you sweat in the midsection and burn calories like no tomorrow.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KWIOF2Y TNT Waist Trimmer Ab Belt: Stomach Fat Burner & Toner &#x2605; Extra Wide to Cover Entire Midsection &#x2605; Uniquely Designed to Repel Sweat & Moisture w/ Anti-Slip Grid Technology &#x2605; No Slipping or Movement of Fabric! Premium Body Shaper, Slimm...]]<br /><br />I love the ab carver, adore my jump ropes, and I'm wearing my waist trimmer right now as I type this review (no kidding!)...but none of these tools would have done a darn thing to help me reach my weight loss goals if I didn't first lay the foundation with a set of healthy eating habits.  I hate the word diet, so I'll use \"healthy eating habits\".  These pieces of equipment I've mentioned will help, but if you want to really see those abs ya got to watch what eat.  And trust me I wish there was a way around this one because I love salty food but there is most certaintly not - Good luck friends!\n",

      "As usual when you get something new, I was excited to use this TV in my living room. Although, that couldn't be further from what happened...<br /><br />When using one of the HDMI ports, the picture was very fuzzy and nothing seemed to fix that. Also, the picture quality was worse than the TV I was replacing from 5 years ago!<br /><br />This was so hard for me, after spending so much money and to be worse off than I was before.<br /><br />After I dealt with returning this TV and researching as much as possible I found a GREAT 50 inch TV that hasn't given me a single issue in any way.<br /><br />If you want to take a look, it is here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/1vi1LHp<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the TV for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one.\n",

      "We wanted a couple of water balloon launchers for a party we were having so we picked up this one and a few others. Over the course of the party we definitely became partial to another launcher, [[ASIN:B004FRXKEW 300 Yard Water Balloon Launcher]]. While this one worked it didn't launch as far as the Bam Launcher and it didn't seem as durable. The CX Blaster launcher felt like it was made from lower quality rubber and there was visible wear after an afternoon of heavy use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun toy but I wouldn't really suggest the CX Blaster over one of the Bam Launchers.\n",

      "You would imagine that the title of this review refers to the fact that this camera is much more than a point and shoot. Unfortunately it' s not. The fact that it needs a dozen of settings to run, makes it quite complicated and you might miss a few good photos because of that.

It constantly moves around and constantly losing grip of the belt. We have to, of course, fix it constantly as well so it gets annoying. Other than that, it’s easy to clean, no stinky odors are stuck to it and my dog seems loving it. I just hope there’s a better way to fix the moving around seat cover problem. Nevertheless, I gave it 3 stars since I still love the idea and the design along with it.\n",

I thougt i could wear it even though it broke after a while (around 15 mins.) the chain (wich isn't even metal) the coating started to peel of i was diapointed, if you want to wear a necklace i purpose you look elese where if you want a long-lasting necklace i suggest the Heartless necklace or the set of sora's keyblade pendant set.

      "This post has been slightly moderated to satisfy Amazon's rules of posting.<br />This is a smaller overview that will enable people to see more easily what the full PDF is about. It shows why there is a need for a rebuttal. Morgan attacked by book with lies as I can show. Those who then wish to proceed to the full PDF will be welcome. My web site is at PROBITYPRESS.COM.<br />JOHN MORGAN: A FRAUDSTER EXPOSED<br />IF ANYONE WISHES TO ASK QUESTIONS, OR MAKE A STATEMENT, I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO RESPOND TO YOU ALL PERSONALLY.<br />I have written a book called The Princess Diana Conspiracy that has been attacked by a fraudster called John Morgan. Morgan has written a load of rubbish about my book and said there are two hundred errors in it and then expands that onto 500. One of Morgan's team of loyal \"reviewers\", Hiram, has arbitrarily increased that number to 600. It is all an exaggerated corruption.<br />This is a logical way for MI6 to progress their campaign. But they would also like you to read Morgan's rubbish because he espouses corrupt inquest evidence and so supports their purpose. If you fall for it, then Diana will become a fading footnote of history but the monarchy will also be safe for another number of years until it finally succumbs to the inevitable but too late for Diana's justice.<br />To all those souls that demand justice for Diana I ask you to consider the points I make. It will take a little of your time but Diana will benefit from your diligence and be closer to being avenged. You will follow my logic; most will recognize the truth having read this PDF.<br />I place you on my web, just before the PDF.<br />God bless<br />Alan<br /><br />JOHN MORGAN: AN UNPLEASANT BUT NECESSARY REBUTTAL<br />INTRODUCTION<br />An unpleasant task follows; one I cannot sidestep. Someone called John Morgan from Brisbane, Australia has compiled several books about Diana over the last few years taken directly from the Diana inquest transcripts. My book is sellingwell; his aren't selling. He has attacked my book with a criminal, so called, \"review\" that is false so I must put the record straight. Morgan's books are seriously flawed but I must also illustrate his purpose in writing his odious and corrupt little so called \"review\". Here is a free PDF download. I ask that you please make the ultimate judgement.<br />OVERVIEW<br />My book, the Princess Diana Conspiracy, has sold well and convinced many people about Diana being murdered; this hasn't pleased MI6. They tried to prevent my book from reaching the US market by sending my first book shipment back to the UK. Amazon.com was also later persuaded that my book was made of \"hazardous materials\"; this prevented it's availability around the time I was on four US TV shows and five US radio shows in September which was a critical time for my book's exposure. I also appeared on the Geraldo at Large show in New York and wasn't told I would be met by Imogen Lloyd Webber (MI6) who tried hard to debunk my views. Now MI6 recruit a failed author to assist them.<br />MI6 use Morgan's services because he is more concerned about money than justice for Diana. He has written several boring, disastrous books and has latched onto \"The Princess Diana Conspiracy\" to advertise them. He wrote his \"review\" based on his flawed opinions, not facts. Despite acknowledging that the inquests evidence is corrupt, he uses this same material to debunk my book and to write all of his own books; it is all he has. How anyone can write an account of what happened to Diana by using this same corrupt evidence and without challenging it, escapes me. MI6 had ten years to sanitize evidence and Morgan's views reflect the inquests findings, thus showing that he supports MI6.<br />I show that a huge number from Morgan's list of my supposed \"errors\" are either complete nonsense, his ignorance of the pre inquest evidence or his own baseless opinions. Morgan suggests his opinionsare indisputable and other \"errors\" are what he calls my \"Power Constructs\"; these are where he doesn't accept the evidence I present because he doesn't possess it. All are my supposed \"errors\" and a large number of examples are shown in the PDF. Morgan didn't start looking into the details about this vile crime until 2006. I began in 2003 so I use this pre inquest evidence to challenge the evidence that emerged from the inquest. Morgan perversely extolls the inquest evidence whilst also stating it is corrupt.<br />He attacks me by saying that \"All investigative books-I include my own-have some errors. That is not the issue. The issue here is the level and type of error\". So he pins the justification for his attack not on any errors but on the level and type of my supposed errors that apparently indicate I am working with MI6 (I am not). So, if you are content that the examples I show in the PDF illustrate Morgan's point is rubbish, and you may even regard his comments as pathetic, you will clearly see his purpose.<br />This was not a labour of love but done out of necessity. If we are to have justice and bring the truth to light then I need to clarify Morgan's purpose and send him to your mercy; not of my choice. Please find the time to read the full review on my web and take your own stance. Don't let this man pervert the course of justice now when my book takes us so close. Demand justice for Diana, Princess of Wales and deny MI6 their hard fought for victory.<br />PDF FOLLOWS ON WEB<br /> (I did make mistakes in The Princess Diana Conspiracy and have apologised. But these genuine errors were corrected and published as an eBook three weeks before Morgan's corruption emerged so his pathetic comments about my MI6 association and raising false flags etc., by deliberately giving out false information, are proven untruths; he knew I was pursuing justice. I had already corrected the genuine errors earlier so clearly wasn't trying to laya false trail. Please understand this point because it's the bedrock of Morgan's excuse for his corruption and proves this man is a criminal. I have now finished a review of my entire book and it is being typeset; it will be with the printers next week and also an update will be sent for the eBook. I shall also be extra careful when I send the files to the printers this time to ensure they arrive intact-more later.)\n",

      "I've got 2 iPhones and several iPods in the family. Every car has a car charger and every room in the house has an AC charger. As everyone knows, no matter what you do to try and conserve battery life on the iPhone, you inevitably run out of power. Ever since I got the QCell, that problem no longer exists. The QCell is small enough to just throw in your backpack, briefcase, purse, etc and know that you are covered. The charge time to get the phone back to a \"worry-free\" level is quite impressive. Those marathon conference calls that seem to occur when you are away from a power source used to be an issue. The long airline flights where you are playing a game on the iPhone, and even though you are in airplane mode, the battery still doesn't last. Well, with the QCell, both those problems is solved. The led comes in handy too when you are in a bind. The laser pointer is nice too, but I don't think I will ever use it. There are plenty of miniscule laser pointers out there, that are more comfortable and convenient to use.\n",

Also the silicone around the cap leaves a nasty taste on the rim of the lid.The lid doesn't smell like anything to me when it's clean / prior to use and I've diligently scrubbed it, so I can only conclude that it's poor-quality plastic that's leaching something into my cup.\n",

It is one of those necessities that you really don't need to have in life, but because you're with a lot of people, taking front camera pictures becomes difficult. Other than that, this is a very versatile thing to have. If you have money to shell out, this is a good buy.\n",

      "I purchased this TV last month as a bedroom TV. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret buying it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming very quickly as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, one of the HDMI ports proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. I tried to deal with it for as long as I could but then decided this wasn't what I paid for.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for much CHEAPER!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 50 inch TV, check this one out here on Amazon -------&#62; http://amzn.to/SOVo0e<br /><br />I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!<br /><br />If you do decide this isn't the TV for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one!\n",

      "The way these are supposed to work is the suction cups grip the window and hold the shade up.  We tested both shades on window glass and the suction cups held for about 2 minutes before giving up.  These come with black suction cups.  We tried moistening the cups with water, they held about 10 seconds.  We tried the last resort, isopropyl alcohol and had similar results to water.  The whole idea is shot when the suction cups don't work.  The shade is well-made and folds up nicely.    Update on 1/27/2015:  Great Customer Service! The company informed me that I might have received an older pair of shades and will re-send a new pair to me.  I will update it after testing the new pair.    Update on 1/30/2015:  Sellers were very good to help us get a screen that works for us.  We now have a working screen and believe the suction cup problem is due to the suction cups being folded over in the package during shipping.  We're all set, thanks to the sellers help.\n",

First off all I ordered this via prime 2 day shipping. It took 4 days to arrive.  Strike one.  Secondly, the way this product is already making me feel from this short amount of time really worries me (i.e. irritable at work, easily flying off the handle at people, little things bug me more than usual, etc etc).  Strike two.  Now if these feelings of irritably and aggressiveness translate into a better workout in the gym and better overall gains, I might change my review, but for now other than some extra energy this product is causing me to be pissed off more than anything else\n",
      "Getting this TV for my bedroom, I figured it would work out just great even though it was such a good deal for just over $200...<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the stand and it's strength compared to the weight of the TV. I could hardly believe that it was able to support the TV for any length of time being so flimsy and wobbly.<br /><br />The picture was actually worse than the 5 year old TV I was replacing, I just couldn't believe that was even possible!<br /><br />The last thing that had me decide to try a different TV was the HDMI port having an issue where the picture was fuzzy and I had to jiggle the cord to get it to go normal, even with multiple cords.<br /><br />I ended up returning the TV and getting one I have never been happier with! It's been almost two months and I have yet to have an issue.<br /><br />I bought it here on Amazon ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qcVVnZ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the TV for you, at least you have a heads up about this one!\n",

      "I really, really want to give the Lego Falcon a five star rating. It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I've since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star.<br /><br />It really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can't. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I've read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don't see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn't seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built.<br /><br />Okay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff.<br /><br />This is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that's mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon.<br /><br />Also, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke's Jedi training ball (even though it`s on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets.<br /><br />The inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can't help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of.<br /><br />Also the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic \"New Hope\" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han's absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it's seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH.<br /><br />A couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It's really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can't be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought.<br /><br />Overall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it's still very much worth it.\n",
      "I bought this to use as a printer stand and it was the exact size and style I wanted. After I assembled it I wished I had also used Liquid nails for more permanent construction but as I won't be moving it around, it'll be fine.\n",

Anyway can watch without getting board. First film was a unique one; i have never watched anything like it ever in my life. This one is more close to a massacre film. Extreme violence; but that is all.\n",

      "Cool and unique ring! My husband put it right on, he liked that he never saw a ring like this before.  It is flexible and he recommends selecting a finger that is within 1-size of the actual ring size for the best fit. The ring fits so comfortably, he forgets he is wearing it.  I purchased this ring at a reduced rate for my review and made my husband so happy.\n",
      "I bought this gift for my 2 yr old niece whose birthday was very recently. I had no idea what to get her but I did a little searching on amazon and I found a bunch of really great, cute gifts for her age group. This is one of the gifts that I got. We opened it up during her birthday party and played it a bit with her and her friends. They all had such a great time. My sister thanked me and assured me that it is going to get a lot of use in the next fear years.\n",
      "I just began to watch this season and I'm still not sure if I like it yet... It does seem pretty good, but I think the cast for the most part sounds way to cool and calm. ALWAYS. My attitude may change though... guess I'll figure it out...\n",
      "But nope, came and looked fine from the outside, but once opened realized the leg was seriously bent. And there was a dent in the same side. I tried bending it back into installable shape and then the paint started coming off at the bend.\n",
      "These were really priced right. As some other reviews indicated, they are a tad on the lightweight side but it is something I prefer as opposed to heavyweight athletic type socks. The fit is great and I feel I got a terrific value and a very speedy delivery. I would highly recommend this item for anybody that prefers a medium weight  Sock.\n",
      "This is an awesome cleaning set, coming with everything that will let you clean your camera, frustration-free. Of course, that's assuming that you know how to clean your camera in the first place.\n",
      "I really like this scarf! It is so beautiful and comfortable. Yesterday, I and I only wear them today. This material is not difficult, do not sweat the neck, it's just perfect for fall and winter. I would recommend it to anyone, I ordered today. I got the black, it's true colors and lengths, so that you can see in the picture is you. I love I wear so many different wear fact, you can wear or fall. I love it!\n",
      "Its ok. When I went to assemble the legs, I found that two of the legs had a wide crack going down the entire side. Luckily, the cracks could face the inside and out of sight. Decided not to send it back- thinking that if the legs do split into two pieces, I can superglue them back together. The top seems to fit a little too tightly to use the tray side without making a huge effort to pull the two pieces apart. I don't think it was worth the money I paid for it, and actually saw it offered at a lower price later on another site.\n",
      "Just what I was looking for as far as color, material used and wrist size. The reason I returned it was because it was too heavy - really too much weight on my wrist and too large for blouse sleeves - they kept getting caught on it. I was sad that I had to return it.\n",
      "These earrings were a bit larger than we expected. They look just like the picture with a nice depth to the strong, clear color. This item is a gift that the recipient wills definitely be able to wear everyday.\n",
      "Ok, after a few bad products, now this is the third wheelchair I have purchased for Gracie, but finally a keeper... it is better than the first two for a few reasons. One thing is that it has a better balance than his k9 cart which the side bars on that cart bent after just a few weeks so I returned it. The other cart was from walkin wheels, it was expensive in price but cheap in design, it never worked well and broke only after a few days... We have been using this BFM cart for 2-months now and it's a good wheelchair, but I have to complain about the tread on the tires has already worn off a good bit. The company actually sent me two new tires for free, but I can only give 4-stars that the tread would wear down so quickly...\n",
      "This case doesn't even deserve 1 star. The quality is really bad. Nothing like the photos which were obviously photoshopped. The back part scratches way too easily and inner layer looks so cheap. Waste of time and money.\n",
      "Great pair of classic hoops. Great weight, the clasps are comfortable, however be careful, they are easily undone, and they'll go flying! I wouldn't wear them if you are gonna be doing any sport like activities.\n",

      "The dress is with good quqality, thank you. The color is nice. And i like the design of the dress, it is very fit on body, and is very sexy. Thank you.\n",
      "I love this bedding, only problem was the mobile we received with it was messed up and corroded! Was not happy because now we can't use it or return it. Thought the quality could have been a little bit better. Also, it only came with one window valace, most rooms have two windows do they not?\n",
      "This is a great little work bench for a toddler. I like it because there are also project instructions and materials included so that an adult can play with their toddler and create a few projects. Nice!\n",
      "I bought my GT P1000 last year and I was very happy at first. Now that it's more than a year, I get more and more disappointed with it.<br />A month after I bought the item, 2nd gen Galaxy Tabs were released with the same price. At first I didn't feel any regret but then my GT crashes so many times the longer it's in my hands. It keeps turning off for no reason. Sometimes I just compose text and out of nowhere it reboots. Sometimes I don't use it that much then the graphics get all wrecked (I really can't tell what happens exactly but the colors somewhat distort or something) It showed during the first few months I bought it but not too often and would usually go back to normal once I reboot but now it's really becoming annoying.<br />It's also bulky and heavy not like the new ones. I just gave away my GT to my brother after a year because it annoys me too much just looking at it.<br />I liked it when I bought it and thought I made a good investment but I regret having it. I gave it three stars because the specs overall is still good but it doesn't live up to how it should.\n",
      "My little guy is now 2.5 years old, and these toys have been a bath time companion for the past 6-7 months. He absolutely loves them, and his favorite is the blue one. They are a great size for his small hands.\n",
      "One of the good TV series in the last 20 years, and worth the price to be able to work your way through the series, episode by episode...I only wish that they had continued the series with Jimmy Smits and his Presidency being the premise.\n",
      "I love these earrings. I wear them everyday and now my friend wants to buy the same as well, but I won't tell her where I got them from :P. Anyway I really like them and the only downfall was the slow shipping. Otherwise I highly recommend.\n",
      "This has always been my favorite chocolate. I always gift this during occasions. Love it, but it's starting to get pricey over time.\n",
      "We love this table.It's sturdy and seems durable, which is good for  teenage boys. I would defiantly recommend this table.\n",
      "These were terrible cartridges! Printer kept giving me error message as if ink were empty after only 5 pages or so. Took them out and cleaned contacts and still would not work. I got a total of about 10 pages out of both black cartridges combined. I have purchased other refurbished cartridges never had problems.\n",
      "This product serves it's purpose, but isn't very sturdy. I still have some books to put on the lower shelves that I am a bit concerned about it holding the weight. I bought it because the price was right and it is for my home office. I didn't want to buy anything expensive for a room no one hardly sees. If you don't plan on placing all books or very heavy things, it should be fine.\n",
      "I returned this product twice - the scent was mostly alcohol, which means the testers are either really old or the fragrance somehow separated from its alcohol base, perhaps due to poor storage and/or the hot temperatures....... very disappointing\n",
      "The ties are very thin. Don't let it touch any hook side of a velcro as it will strip and ruin the tie. Other than that for the price these ties look great.\n",
      "the exercise bar that i received looks NOTHING to the one that i shown on the image above! i had been waiting for this for days and when i got it, i was disappointed<br />theses people have bad service as they cant even send me the correct exercise bar!\n",
      "I had two ferbies when I was growing up and the fact that they're back made me so happy! I am ordering one from my brother and hey i'm a big little kid, so one for myself as well. It seems a lot more advanced then the old Ferbies.\n",
      "Watch was a little too flashy for me. It wasn't overkill, but it just didn't have the balance of professionalism and flash that I require. I couldn't see myself wearing this with my suits. Maybe my sports coats.\n",
      "The quality of the chocolate is the best. The variety was good as well for the one I picked. They're delicious and it's very hard for me to stay away from them (because I am dieting and, of course, they're not of much help in this situation).\n",
      "I went on a vacation in Guam. It was a relief that I had already purchased these. The hotel had similar items, but they wanted to charge way too much for it. I'm glad I got the three pack. It was handy as I had several electronics to charge.\n",
      "Excellent size and works like a charm, sadly after the second use the stitching came undone at the end of the velcro fastener I will continue to use it until it completely falls apart. Fair warning...it is not the best made product.\n",
      "Not a good slouchy hat at all. It does not slouch correctly and it seems to be too small. Don't recommend at all.\n",
      "Didn't seem to work at all - in the junk drawer. Buyer beware! I would go with a more advanced way to check your bills.\n",
      "A nice clean looking fan that works great on a lower ceiling. I am using this fan on an outside porch. I wanted a fan that was clean looking, weather resistant and easy to clean. The integrated 100 watt light works great and can be dimmed to the user's requirements.\n",
      "Very loud and the foot pedal does not work right, when I press to start sewing it won't go, and when I stop it still wants to run, very aggravating, Got this machine to do my quilting on and it doesn't hardly want to pull fabric thru. Wish I could get money back. Very disappointed.\n",
      "This thing is dream. Small wheel radius means easy to pedal. I have the single speed, no hills here in beach.. It is a delight to ride. Moves along just fine. I go to the store, cuts down on gas usage and fighting the other drivers (very impatient drivers here).\n",

      "I absolutely love these leggings they are professional for everyday work and can be dressed down..worn with boots or heels… very sexy ...I have almost all the colors the denim ones are just as great.. ..Since I have been losing weight I have ordered more in my new size the price is just right\n",
      "The price seemed good and it technically worked, but it still should give you a functioning computer screen.<br /><br />The biggest issue with this is the dead pixels, tons of them appeared fairly quickly and I couldn't figure out why. I also wouldn't call the resolution anything special, I have smaller monitors that have looked better and are a few years older.<br /><br />I dealt with this performance for a little while but had to do something about it before I went crazy.<br /><br />I did some research and found a monitor that is SO much better and hasn't dropped a pixel in over two months, even though I don't expect it to ever.<br /><br />I bought it here on Amazon too ----------&#62; http://amzn.to/SHHmgn<br /><br />It is a great monitor and you won't regret using it. If you don't decide to get it, at least I could point others in the right direction!\n",
      "I’m taking care of my grandma’s cat now and he’s really old and won’t eat as much solid food now. I have to mush them up just so he doesn’t starve. I wanted this one to work but he didn’t even sniff it.\n",
      "My little girl loves Frozen and everything to do with it, so this toy was practically a given. But I was barely able to make it work, and even then I felt like it would fall apart easily. Luckily, my daughter knows how to care for her stuff, but this toy still feels pretty cheap for the value it provides.\n",
      "The mp3 player is fine for what it is and at its price, but I encountered it to drain the battery very fast. As well as problems getting the computer to 'read' it to add songs. Then you have to convert songs into mp3 format to even transfer them onto the device for it to work.\n",
      "These are good batteries, I like that they are rechargeable because I hate blowing money on new ones! They can get super expensive. These charged up quickly and worked in the items I used them in. I am not sure how long they will last, but I'll make notes and share more once they do die.\n",
      "I was searched on Amazon for something to keep my iPhone 6+ dry and I found this seller provide greatest price and the picture is the same as other company picture which is higher price. And I sent the link to my friend to purchased my favorite pink color. I was surprised the item delivered very fast. But guess what? Strong CHEMICAL SMELL, immediately I feel like want to vomit!!!… Also IT CAN'T HOLD MY IPHONE 6+ VERTICALLY AS THE PICTURE SHOWN!!! Also No Brand at all, can't see anywhere written CRENOVA. I have 42 inch waist size and this product CAN'T fit me, AGAIN Wrong Description! At last the triple zip lock is not matching each other, they just not fit well and very hard to close, HOW CAN IT BE WATERPROOF!<br />Very disappointed experience with CRENOVA product, I have returned the item. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR.\n",
      "This seemed like a huge amount of candy at one delivery. However, I pass it along to my chocoholic friends at our social events.<br />Suggestion: During summer, don't forget to put a bar in the freezer for a couple hours before eating.\n",
      "Slather it on to keep yellow jackets from biting (they seem to think I would make a fine meal); works for about an hour. Probably would not stop yellow jackets from stinging if they are annoyed.\n",
      "I honestly haven't used it yet as I am still pregnant. It seems to be areasonable buy so far. The design appears appropriate for a new baby! A word of advice to new moms: avoid the bath tubs with the foam lining it as the foam mildews and is very difficult to keep clean!\n",
      "I usually have a hard time finding watches that fit my wrist as it is small. This watch fits great. I love the small size, yet the numbers are very visible. I also love the material the band is made of. Many watches roll around my wrist, which is annoying. This watch stays in place and is very comfortable. I'm thinking of ordering a few more.\n",
      "This bed is great for my 3 year old, he loves it. Downside to it, it was difficult to put together. Some of the pieces don't go together as well as they should! Also you need an extra set of hands for connecting the headboard/footboard. But once it was fully put together I couldn't keep my little boy away from it!\n",
      "This is a great product. Even though I'm not into games this console made me rethink that. The full immersion concept is a lot if fun. Id recommends this product to anyone who might on the fence about buying it. Buy it from here for their price & excellent customer service.\n",
      "I started using this glitter spray tonight before my base paint was fully dry. I decided to wait a little longer to apply the glitter. Four hours later I came back to the same bottle of glitter paint and it was clogged and would only shoot paint a few droplets at a time. I had to hold the can three inches away from my project to get the paint on and I could only apply it in globs. What a waste of money. It doesn't matter if you read the instructions, which I did and followed. The tip/applicator is not right for the paint formula.\n",
      "My suggestion? Don't buy this. It makes all of these rings around the cubes, and it just breaks off in pieces. I've tried it over and over, even using different levels, and still nothing useful.\n",
      "Maybe it is me, but this thing as stretchy and pliable as it is was, was very tight fitting. Even with plenty of water-based lube it was literally chocking me. The concept and small palm size is great, but they need to make a larger version. I just could not seem to get a comfortable tug from it. I love most of the Doc products, but this one was very tight. It ended up tearing after a few attempts.\n",
      "see its good but difficult in installation so you have to work on it first overall its a good product and the features are very usefull\n",
      "Easy to set up, great sound for the price. Shipping was fast. I've had the system up and running for about two weeks and I love it. I added two rear speakers to have a surround setup. This is a very loud system for an apartment but you have several ways to control the bass output.\n",
      "Great movies. If you love 80s horror movies like the evil dead, the lost boys, the return of the living dead, killer klowns from outer space, etc. you will like this. I would almost classify this as a horror comedy. It is just an all around fun movie. Check it out!\n",
      "My sister ordered these for me. The picture makes them look nicer than they are. The bristles will not hold their sharp point or any useful shape at all.\n",
      "I bought these for my son and he likes using it however he sometimes has problems taking them off since they are hard to get off.\n",
      "I purchased the Nero sink and get lots of oohs and ahhs over its unique styling. The color is a deep charcoal, but not black. The material seems very durable and hasn't scratched at all yet (2 months). I was a little worried that the texture of the surface (which is about the texture of the inside of an iron skillet) might hold food particles, but that hasn't really been an issue.<br /><br />My only concern is that the guidance on cleaning from the swanstone company pretty much eliminates every cleaner on the market. No bleach and no ammonia? Almost everything has at least one of these. Without either of these, you are pretty much out of choices. That said, I have found a very successful cleaning ritual. I start with  warm water/dish soap/scrubbing sponge and finish with a wipe down with a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and this seems to do a great job. I am a fan of bleach, so I do miss the sense of clean the burning odor of bleach gives, but don;t want to risk hazing up the finish.<br /><br />18 MONTH UPDATE. The finish on this sink remains flawless which I find very impressive. I have found a good cleaning routine as well. I use dish soap (e.g. Dawn) and a scrubbing sponge with very hot water most of the time. If it looks like ti needs a a little extra care, I follow that with a granite cleaner and polish. I go about 3 months between polishing and it still looks like the day I installed it.\n",
      "Great idea but very poorly executed.<br />We loved the idea of playing Giant Jenga in our backyard but this is not satisfactory.<br />Yeah, the size is ok but it's not really that big.<br />Note this game does not include a storage bag so it's got nowhere to go once it's unpacked.<br />I have now bought another far superior item.\n",
      "I really do love the fact that I bought this product. I bought it for my husband's birthday and ended up loving them for myself. They are considered \"Unisex\" so their shouldn't be a problem right?? Lol. I think anyone interested in this product, should defently purchase ASAP!!!!\n",
      "Great little hand-sized speaker. Great for tunes in the garden, or camping! I liked the size, color and connectivity .

      "I don't like how it looks. It looks so disgusting. but my cat loves it. Moyi because fat after taking this and I think she love it so much. She can finish a bowl even for few seconds. I won't be surprised of she became so fat. I would really laugh to see her having  a hard time walking. Now, she would be like me. Oh, I am just kidding. I don't want her to be so fat. But I won't stop feeding her this because she loves it, again.\n",

      "Not what this claims.  I sure don't think these are no 1500.  I would look elsewhere if that is what you are looking for.\n",
      "The drill performs great. long lasting battery life, quick charging time. ONLY problem i have found is that the chuck doesn't tighten enough. Every once in a while the chuck will loosen and my drill bit holder will fall out. No matter how much i try to tighten it. Did i get a defective one? anyone else having this problem?\n",

      "I ordered this for my five year old son but ended up being too complicated for him. I tried playing it with my husband though a few days after and we had a blast. It's a challenge just setting up the structures and the pleasure of ruining what he so painstakingly put up is a gameplay not available in the original game. That is why I'm giving it a four.\n",
      "When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1oZcc2j<br /><br />I promise, they are well worth what they cost.

      "Great product for the price. The stitching was poor as thread was pulled out in many locations. After further inspection it seems to be excess stitching that was never trimmed. Looked worse than it was.\n",
      "These are yummy!! If you have to watch sugar these are great for a little something sweet. They are so much better then the sugar free hard candies I used to get years ago. If you didn't read the wrapper you would never know it was sugar free. Very good!!!\n",

I did get one of the black to work, and it seemed under filled, but it could again have been that our printer did not like the cartridge.\n",

It's not extremely cheaply made, but it is not high end either. It is easy to put together and reclines well. Overall we are pleased and ours sits on carpet.\n",
      "I don't get paid until I can find a person so I need practical and legal means to find a person with a way to verify.

I have more than 12 years experience as a small collection agency owner.\n",
      "The bag looks great and the material/zippers, etc. appear to be good quality. The only issue I have is that the retractable handle is a bit too short. I am not tall (5'7&#34;), and I have to bend over slightly to pull it along. If the handle were about 3 inches longer, it would have been perfect.\n",

      "So, this iPad Dock was the last thing I ever thought I would use as much as I do, but once I got started saving songs on my iPad, really a lot of them, and found out I could hook it right up to my stereo, I was in a different world. Now my iPad sits on my desk at the office, and pipes right into my little stereo there so my office is always filled with nice, easy listening music. I'd play Rock-n-roll, but office politics say \"no harsh music\". But the music I listen to are my favorite easy tunes, right off the iPad through this Dock.\n",

      "It was okay. I was pleased to see that the video wasn't boring and the people on it didn't seem like robots like most exercise videos I have tried. The music was good as well. The DVD itself was very inspirational, I just think it's more than I am ready to commit to. So, I am taking points off for that. t contains 24 exercises that work on your shoulders, abs, obliques, legs, and glutes. I have no doubt that the program works, but it has to be something you're committed to. It's not something you can do for like 5 minutes a day and end up with a dancer's body. It's a satisfying, total body workout. A friend of mine used the system and she's looking amazing. I just don't have the discipline. So, if you're dedicated, then I'm sure you will look great. If it's a half-hearted attempt then there's probably another option.\n",

      "It's not easily cleaned and can easily become gross from the type of toy it is. Also, the noise that it did make was sub-standard. I was very disappointed in this product as M&D items are usually fantastic.\n",
      "I had to purchase this matches because I me and my friends are planing to go mountain hiking and, i think that having this matches would be a bright idea. I tried to light-up some matches and they did work, even when wet but not as well as the expensive brands but this will do...\n",

      "A few months ago I had just gotten the PS4 and wanted a quality headset to go with it.<br /><br />My old headset was comfortable and worked well, I loved the bass you could hear with them but they weren't cutting it anymore.<br /><br />When I tried these I was definitely unhappy... The speakers would make an unbearable noise that sounded like rattling most of the time, even at lower volumes. If this wasn't bad enough, one speaker kept cutting out. I had to bang on the side to get it to start working again.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't enjoy these and can't imagine why they are charging so much for them.<br /><br />After this depressing experience I did some serious research and found a headset I absolutely LOVE.<br /><br />It's been over a month and I can't find anything to complain about. The sound and bass is great and I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort.<br /><br />I got them on Amazon actually -------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1wbUoC2<br /><br />Even if they aren't the ones for you, I hope I could help share my story with this pair.\n",
      "Our group got this and a bunch of other snack items for a party and we're talking about people who would eat absolutely anything. When they finally got to this, absolutely no one liked it. Out of all the chips and chocolate bars, this was the only item to have been left barely touched.\n",

      "It was difficult to use. The neck part was uncomfortable. When it arrived the wheel that holds the tension coil was broken. I called the company as instructed and they did not have a replacement part. They said they were going to send out a whole new unit, but, I have yet to receive it.\n",

      "Where should i start! The idea is good but the finished product misses the mark. The rhinestones are stamped on, mine our on a curve. I paid over ten dollars for expedited shipping, it got held up.<br /><br />They graciously credited my account for shipping. They also credited me six dollars since the stones are not lined up straight. I guess i am supposed to be happy... I do not like buying merchandise that in time i may or may not like. Generally, time does not improve my feelings for a product.\n",

      "I was expecting very much from this laptop, having in mind the fact tat its price is not what you could call cheap. Unfortunately, it is build of cheap materials and it is very slow. From time to time I work with Photoshop. I am not a Power User, therefore I don't need a powerful workstation for this application. My old Dell was doing a very good job here. But this new HP Folio is a disaster: it takes forever to load the app and each operation I make in Photoshop is extremely slow.<br />Cannot recommend this product.\n",
      "This is a product that really comes to hand when you are travelling or even when you depend on your cellphone.

      "This product is a definite yum for me, so I would have to give it all five stars to encourage others to have the same excellent experience.\n",
      "This product really worked and was surprisingly easy to use. After researching online, I discovered that MMD's method for testing was identical to the experts.. I was quoted about 5 times as much to have someone come to my house and conduct the same testing. The report I got back from My Mold Detective was very easy to understand, too. I sent off the samples to the lab and waited three days to get results which was shorter than the local IEP's turn around time that I was quoted... I guess a week or ten days is the norm... But, sending off the samples was explained on the packaging and I double checked on the website. I rate this product 4.5 stars\n",
      "I can't believe this Piece of JUNK (cleaned up for publication) is STILL being sold.  I got one after seeing it at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas (Jan. 2014).  Thought it was a great idea until I tried to get it to work.  IT WOULDN'T.  I contacted their so-called customer service who promised to send me complete instructions.  I waited, and waited.  I contacted them again.  NOTHING.  I packed up the unit and found I couldn't return it BECAUSE...they took too long to get back to me and the 30-day return window had closed.  I took SKYBELL with me this year (Jan 2015) to CES to give it back to these people IN PERSON with a few well-chosen comments...and guess what??  They didn't appear at CES this year.  If you got this POJ to work, congrats.  For me, it's a $200 mistake.\n",
      "I bought this boot less than four months ago. I am retired but work out side as I see fit. The fit was great and I loved the comfort, until the toe got a hole worn in it just from kneeling in the garden and occasionally on the wooden floor on which I was working.\n",

      "I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased the Special K Shakes after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on the Special K Shakes and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----&#62; http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.\n",
      "I would have expected a bit higher quality in the packaging of this.  I don't really think this particular one is worth anything extra.  Not sure what they where thinking when producing this.  Note this doesn't refer to the movies themselves.\n",

      "I received a malfunctioned case :/. Once I got it, I saw that padlock protectors were broken together with padlocks - which is an utterly disappointing experience. To make things worst, the case was too small for my pelican even though in the description, it said that it could fit most of them.<br /><br />I returned the item and I bought a Pelican 1650 (http://amzn.to/13zGr7a) which is much safer and harder to lockpick. It had additional place for camera, so I was pretty satisfied.\n",
      "My dog won’t even go near it. It’s like that time I spilled bleach. He scampered right out of the room. After reading the reviews, it might have been for the best.\n",
      "I brought it in the shower once and now it doesnt work anymore it goes but its stuck in place. It kinda sucks because i actually liked it. It sucks because you cant read any of the instructions or the box since its in jappanesse and i cant call and ask for a replacement or anything because the number on the site doesnt work. Kind of feel like i wasted 70$...\n",
      "I really love this shower speaker. It was very easy to setup and link it to my Android HTC smartphone. IT sounds great in my  my bathroom and it has enough stamina to run for more than 1 day. However, the design is not as beautiful as it seems to be in the pictures which are posted here.\n",

      "I purchased this stroller to use for my granddaughter who is 14 months old. She seems to like it very much. There is a cup holder for her and one for me as well. There is plenty of room for storage on the bottom. It is pretty sturdy, and very easy to fold.\n",
      "I thought the color was texture coated gunmetal like the matching settee, coffee table and chairs with the same pattern and from the same manufacturer. They were not. The chairs and table were painted shiny black and very scratched.\n",
      "The bench arrived promptly, appears to be exactly as described and actually had a better appearance that the photo HOWEVER, the shipment only included the bench parts itself...no instructions and no hardware and so my husband being the handyman that he is decided to buy the hardware, and drill a few holes that were missing and voila! A great bench that looks wonderful on our porch.  I will recommend to friends but with reservations.\n",

      "I will have to agree with the others, the quality on this unit isn't there.  I've had good luck with some other Black and Decker items but not this one.  Had the handle loose in the box, didn't even survive shipping...\n",
      "I had one before but a friend talked me out of it so since I had given mine away when I saw this I knew I wanted it.  Do yourself a favor and part with just how many bucks to buy this. It's a brilliant very inexpensive tool you'll use every day and it makes life just that much simpler. Thanks for the good service.\n",
      "i ordered this black leather flat shoe and they never disappointed me size the size was ok and also are very comfy to walk with.\n",
      "Pretty neat pen! I got it for my little brother for his birthday, and it was a big hit with him. It's pretty easy to operate and looks realistic - he had a blast showing it off to his friends and getting confused looks before he explained what it was. It takes good quality pictures, and you can get them on the computer by using the USB cable. I think it's pretty neat that you can record with it, too. Overall a pretty good spy pen for the price; makes a great gift and would even be fun to play around with yourself.\n",
      "I was expecting something softer more like a cloth on one side and plastic on other, but its all plastic and cold, but I guess it works for the purpose of changing baby, just use a little blankly on top if changing in the cold commercial bathrooms or other areas. I love the case, its pretty handy, you can just load it with wipes and diapers and you don't need a separate case.\n",
      "Although it is really adorable and my daughter likes it the manufacturer should have considered that this walker needs to be picked up set up with one hand. Pick it up and it opens to the highest level never try to lower it with the baby in it.\n",
      "the only reason I gave just  a four star and not a five is the fact that I was disappointed with the way it folds it is a little heavy, and does not fold to a point I should beable to store it in a compact closet or beneath my bad. Other then that it is a good quality and multi featured machine.\n",
      "I am reviewing the Wubble ball on two levels:<br /><br />ONE, it's a piece of junk! I bought one at Target. I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed. Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable. NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles. &#34;Lifetime replacement warranty&#34; &#34;Do not return to the retailer.&#34; Only problem, they want $7 &#34;handling fee.&#34; BS! Plus the cost of postage to mail it back.<br /><br />TWO, As is typical, since these are only found in Target stores right now, you have a few scalpers on Amazon and eBay who buy up as many as they can at Target (causing them to sell-out quickly) and then they offer them at twice the price.<br /><br />Amazon really needs to put an end to this Third-Party rip-off activity on their website. It really degrades the whole shopping experience.\n",
      "The screws that came with the product were awful. The first screws grooves got worn out whilst screwing them into the door frame. I tried to drill the second one in to prevent it wearing again and the head of the screw snapped clean off. Extremely dissatisfied! I can't use the pull up bar at all because both screws messed up\n",
      "After only a few days my son showed me where the wool in the foot bed was wearing away, not just initial shedding, but to bare fabric below. I have considered sending them back.

      "My cat is an adult size cat who is, per the vets opinion, not over weight and is healthy. I had to shove the poor thing in there. And though he is sweet, my cat doesn't like to be held or cuddled so a smaller crate was definitely a bad idea- he became so distraught he used the bathroom twice in it.\n",
      "I never got to use this.. It was shattered upon delivery. I picked up the box and could hear it was broken inside then small shards started falling out of the box. I just threw it in the dumpster. I didn't want to track it in through my house or put it in my car to deal with return.\n",
      "I purchased a cute little bamboo plant, known to bring luck, for my daughter who was having lots of bad luck. Well, it took a few weeks after it arrived but her luck did improve.

      "This set is greatly useable for day to day repairs. Very firm and solid in the hands. The grips could have been designed a little more comfortable, but these serve their purpose well and with Amazon prime saved me a trip to Home Depot.

      "Hooked up the TV today. Outstanding picture! I did not expect this quality from a low cost TV. Sound is pretty good. When you set up the TV, go to &#34;Audio&#34; section and manually set the bass level to +8, and the treble to +3. This seems to be the best sound setting for this TV. Overall, I am very pleased with this TV.\n",

      "Last time I bought hello kitty necklace which she absolutely loved, and now I bought her this hello kitty stud earrings and it looks cute on her ears! She looks adorable!

      "I purchased this TV last month as a living room TV. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, one of the HDMI ports began to fail and caused the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for WAYYY CHEAPER!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 60 inch TV, check this one out -----> http://amzn.to/1ozWTLS<br /><br />It is here on Amazon and I currently own it now. I have never been HAPPIER!<br /><br />It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here.

I have an iHome in my kitchen & one in my bedroom, and I didn't want to spend over $200 to replace them to charge & listen to my iPod when I upgraded to the newest iPod touch. This adapter will ONLY work if I remove the case I have to protect the iPod, and I didn't even go with a thick or heavy case.<br /><br />Get the 30 pin to 5 pin cable instead, unless you like keeping your iPod caseless.\n",

      "It takes up a lot more room in my apartment than I'm comfortable with. It's also poorly designed in that there's no place to attach a plastic bag to collect the recyclables you put inside of it. Also, when the crates are stacked on top of each other, it's sometimes too clumsy to put certain types of items into each crate's opening unless it's the crate at the top.\n",

The thing that you cannot download videos that you record without a subscription is disappointing and really not worth a price.<br /><br />My friend has a Samsung SmartCam ( http://amzn.to/1zrNtnA ) which was far more superior to this one. It didn't had such a problem and the thing that you can use videos to record anything you want for free is really something that's worth it.\n",

We are approaching our Senior lives and we our updated with these kind of technologies due to our sons and daughters but to use this kind of software in the phone is pretty confusing.

      "It isn't the best looking thing out there. But it does work as a digital clock, and it is reliable. I wish the digits were bigger because it can be hard to see when you just woke up, all weary eyes.\n",
      "I bought this for my new Shih Tzu puppy. She loves it. It has enough room for her bed and a towel down for her to potty on. I am able to see her at all times and have a safe place so she is not underfoot. There is no way she can jump out. This playpen has worked out perfect for her.\n",
      "If you are just looking for a cheap scooter, then by all means go ahead and buy. But be warned that it is not a very stable design (steering in front with no skateboard like sway). Even if you put an adult's brain into a 3 y.o., this scooter would not be fun because of its instability (again, design is the issue).\n",
      "As a beginner, this really helped me practice more and develop my skills in playing guitar. I would love to play music in our church that's why I bought this one. And it's been two months now and I really enjoyed having an acoustic guitar like this. It is very helpful and it's very light. I totally recommend it.\n",
      "This product is really cheap but it does not look like it's cheap at all..It is small and compact but not too small to where it looks cheap. The fabric drawers are not stable in the least, so don't expect to put anything too heavy in them unless you want it to break. The bottom piece is not too stable either. Overall great coffee table for the price and looks good too. Get lots of compliments when guests come over from this table. That makes us feel good\n",
      "I've had a few of these coffee and tea infusions, but I can't say that I really liked any of them. This<br /><br />brew in particular is just out of this world terrible for me, but that might just be my taste talking<br /><br />there.\n",

      "I have used turtle beaches before and something has changed.... Not in a good way.<br /><br />I got this headset two months ago, expecting a decent pair for the decent price they were purchased at, yet I received something entirely different.<br /><br />When you use them for anything with even the smallest amount of bass, it sounds horrible. The noise is as if the speaker is rattling and making a static-like sound every time any bass should be apparent. I tried numerous settings but it still continued.<br /><br />I wish I would have done some research before purchasing them because I would have known to get the pair I have now.<br /><br />I have had this new set for about a month and can't find a single thing to complain about.<br /><br />I bought them here on Amazon too ----------&#62; http://amzn.to/181sLOx<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money on these. If you don't decide the pair I have now isn't the one for you, at least I could help point you in the right direction!\n",
      "Gave this to my parents who have been having trouble with their lawn and the report is not that great. They said that not only did it not work, it caused a rather unpleasant smell. I didn't get to check it yet, but I'll give an updated review once I do.\n",
      "i love this set especially the transplanter with gradation marks. useful, practical set. but the handles are a bit rough, i would have wanted a softer one since i'm almost always by my garden planting various flowers.\n",
      "I put these around the house like an easter egg hunt. Everytime someone goes for a cookie, looks for a mop, or uses the restroom, boom Mr. Beam is staring you down. Sometimes they go off when everyones sleeping. IF that happens it means you have ghosts in your house. Next halloween host the party!\n",
      "I got the Flutterbye Fairy at buzzagent.com #Got it free.  The fairy is very colorful. My kids were very excited when she started flying in the air and spinning with the lights lit up. The only thing I had a problem with is sometimes it would stay on the ceiling. When in a room with lots of space it would fly fine but I took it to a room that  was crowded and it kept crashing into the walls.Overall, it is a good toy that will delight kids as long as they can control the flyng.\n",
      "The belt is comfortable，but not supple enough.I like this belt, its colors match a lot of the jeans I wear.\n",

      "This nori is low quality seaweed. It is not crisp and tasted as though it was expired at the time of opening the package.\n",
      "Love the way it moves. The speaker is not that great, but if you have music on your phone just put it in the cup holder. The sound bounces off and makes it sound louder. It goes up a curb so easily. He looks really comfortable in it. He hasn't complained.\n",
      "I ordered this thinking it would be great but the sides are very mushy and already came bent. Poor quality control. This is a knock off sgp. Stay away.\n",
      "Well, they did replace mine when it broke after using it for 3 months. I enjoyed using it very much and one day, even with proper use and careful handling, the earbud piece got separated from the hard plastic housing, and that was that. They did honor their warranty, though, so yay. I'll probably be buying something else the next time, though.\n",

      "I can't describe how awesome this game is despite a few inconsistencies. The violence and fun are still there which are what made me fall in love with the original GTA games. The controls are more fluid than I remember too which is a huge plus on my book.\n",
      "Pretty much what the title says. It's not going to make you a superstar, it's a pop filter! But it definitely holds up very well. I'm pretty aggressive with my movements because I do a lot of pod casting/video blogging so I have gone through a few filters because I have to keep adjusting and in the end they just fall apart.. Take it for what it is, a solid, sturdy, clean filter that takes a lot of punishment.\n",
      "This iPod docking station is much better than the old one I had. It charges quickly and when I put my iPod on it to play it sounds so much better. I like that it came with a carry case so I can quickly fold it and take it with me on trips.\n",

Edit (3-15-2014): OK the battery seems to work perfectly now.\n",
      "No problems whatsoever. I can finally watch my European DVDs (Dusty Springfield, The Avengers, Thunderbirds and so any others) and my US DVDs without changing machines. The open/close draw is a little slow, but have a little patience..it works. Now go out and get one and enjoy yourself.\n",
      "No good. no difference between previous version and it costs so much more I'm returning ines for sure. What a rip off\n",

      "These Monticello greenhouses are way over priced compared to what other companies offer.  It is amazing how many lower priced, high quality greenhouses you have in the market.  Amazon sells a lot of value oriented products. These greenhouses are no value.\n",

      "I looked at several stores but this is the best price. I have been using these batteries for a few weeks and the solar lights are bright again. I do not know how long the life on these will be, but so far I would recommend them and would purchase them again.\n",
      "A little disappointed, could not program with ease to the cell phone. While listening to music tune, headphone skips in different locations throughout the song. I even tried the same music on a different set of headphones it worked fine.\n",
      "They also on great when I'm very active at the gym and are very comfortable when wearing for long periods. Another great feature is anyone can mold the phones to their ears and if you need more length, you've got the option to extend the cord with the different cord lengths that come in the box.\n",
      "Rita's book have been in the market for almost 15 years now and I studied it when I took the PMP exam first time in 2007. I got busy and failed to collect 60 PDUs and recently had to sit for the exam again. I was never crazy about Rita's book but when I took the test it was my only option. This time I did a lot of research to find out the best PMP book in the market which not only will help the reader to pass the test but also help them understand real life project management with case studies and scenarios. Below is my finding:    Professor Sohel: This book is the best in every possible way. It is written in a language that anyone can understand and mostly every concept is explained with examples. It has summary tables after every topic which is simply spectacular, questions are exactly what you will see in real life exam, extremely structured and well organized. Loved this book. It's very new in the market so I don't think a lot of ppl know about it yet but I am 100% sure that this one will be the number one PMP book soon.  http://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Professional-Certification-Exam/dp/1492310549/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381180&sr=8-1&keywords=sohel    Rita: I will consider Rita's one the second best in the market. It is some time hard to follow and digest. Questions are not as good as the first one.  Head First: I also like this book because it makes sense and easy to follow.  I think a lot of ppl will not appreciate cartoons and images in a PMP book but I liked it.  Questions are not too good but comparing others it does a good job.  http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-PMP-Jennifer-Greene/dp/1449364918/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381221&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+pmp\n",
      "I'll start by saying I never do a review unless I feel strongly about a product--one way or the other. In this case, I strongly feel it was not worth the money. There are several places where, for some reason, paper was attached, then not removed before painting, so you peel the paper away and there are spots that aren't painted.\n",
      "Top drawer is dragging which makes it hard to open, I have nothing in the drawer yet but will probably make it worse. A lot more thinly than I thought it would be. Would be a lot better with rollers in the drawers.\n",
      "It was a good buy, I really like that it's adjustable, and that the form is padded cloth, easy to use pins on. And it was affordable. The base is a little wobbly though.\n",
      "We ordered this for our little boy's nursery and love it! It arrived on time and it great condition. It is really sturdy and looks a lot more expensive than the other corner bookshelves available. It probably took my husband about an hour to put it together. Overall great product!\n",
      "Same as the quality section above. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I considered returning it to them, but since I had it assembled, it was too much to take apart and put in the box as received.\n",
      "This vitamin seems great so far.  Has lots of needed vitamins for every dog.  I give 4 stars because they would be better in maybe a plastic jar instead of resealable bag. Also while 2 of my dogs love them.  One sniffs and refuses to touch it at all. Overall great dog vitamin!\n",
      "This generator is your standard china generator. Seems good for what I will use it for, powering tools. Time will tell. Started right up, runs good, as would be the basic expectation.\n",
      "Easy to install! The doorbell rings perfectly allowing the home owner to hear the doorbell even at a distance. I'm glad I purchase it\n",
      "I read this book off of a friend's table once and she let me borrow it. I have to say that while there are some good points in this book I disagree with much of what is being encouraged here. To even consider them is disgusting to me and I have three wonderful, responsible and loving children who I've never had to treat the way this book advocates.\n",
      "I was excited to start using a tool other than my two regular forks to shred my pulled pork. Unfortunately, this is not the solution to my problem. This is cheap material and not durable. Tips melted, and they were useless.\n",
      "Was very disappointed in the appearance and returned the product before I even used it. I understood it was a refurbished unit, but it came with a big crack on one side and really scratched up on the front.\n",
      "I purchased this TV last month as a bedroom TV. I saw the great price and decent reviews online and decided to take a risk and purchase a TV that had mixed reviews... Boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for nearly the same price, actually $80 cheaper!.<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 40 inch TV, check this one out -----&#62; http://amzn.to/SCb3Qp it is here on Amazon. I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!\n",
      "I purchased this item from here and it took three weeks to be delivered to our store. My children played with it for a month and enjoyed it. Then the back tire blew out. Razor states they have a 90 day warranty so I contacted them.\n",
      "This is an excellent cam for beginners. And it's a great idea by canon of bundling two lenses at such a great price. Covers both landscape & telephoto requirements. Add a 50mm and you have a complete kit.\n",
      "This was kind of silly, but so true that the same time. Basically if you want something, point yourself in that direction and you will get it. Simple enough. Go for it. The book can be summarized and condensed into the maxim: \"go for it\"\n",
      "No surprises. It came within a few days, it looks like it did in the picture and operated fine. The material is a little thin, so I don't think it will provide as much sun protection as I would like, but other than that, so far, so good.\n",
      "This is a quality phone.  Comes with Jellybean OS on it.  The only downfall for me is that the bootloader is encrypted, meaning that it is unlockable.  Might not be a deal breaker for some, but definitely a deal breaker for me.  Wish I new it before I bought it.\n",
      "I was overjoyed when I purchased this ring thinking I was going to get what was pictured. Instead I got a ring that looked dull and cheap. I had read the reviews for this ring and am confused as to what people were looking at as not only was it dull and cheap, the size suggestions were also way off. I will be sending this back for a refund ASAP.\n",
      "Can't begin to say what's wrong with this tablet. I purchased it yesterday and am returning it today. At first connection to internet worked. I was able to get apps, some cases, but they did not work.\n",
      "I enjoy doing this with both friends and family. I bought it for me and my daughter to play, but seem to use it as much as she does.\n",
      "To me this years version of Madden Football was a big disappointment because of the way they changed the franchise mode. If they don't put it back, they will loose a faithful customer of 14yrs.\n",
      "Product is well worth the price paid for it. Is it as good as the ones from 40 years ago? No. But in today's world, it is very acceptable.\n",
      "I bought this because I have a tape deck in my car and wanted to pay music through my ipod. The cord is so thin, it shorted out. It's good to help in a pinch I guess\n",
      "These are adequate cuff links. Not bad, not fantastic. A little on the small side which seems to be the current trend. Clean lines and facing.\n",
      "Horrible. Very junkie. Bought it for a bath remodel. Removed old faucets and went to install these only to find that one of the handles was defective. There was no way to adjust or fix it and have to return.\n",
      "I was looking for two ottomans to put on one side of a coffee table in my living room. Haven't picked out the rest of the furniture yet, but am hoping that these match whatever I do. They are pretty great because I feel like I could put them just about anywhere if they don't work out where planned.\n",
      "Did not even fit on faucet. I tried both of my faucets and then tried my neighbors as well. I put it on as tight as possible and it still squirted water every where. It wouldn't even connect to a hose. It is a shame because I liked the light weight of this hose.\n",
      "I did not find these cases helpful at all, and in fact seem to have worse results. The cases are fine as far as pillowcases go, so if that is all you want, go for it. But if you want them for the reasons I did, I cannot recommend them & that is why I gave them 2 stars.\n",
      "Complex system, very little feedback on why so many listening channels. Only one I found that actually gets the sound in all the speakers. Quality of music isn't there on these speakers. Not that user friendly.\n",
      "I ordered this as a gift. When it was unwrapped the handle was loose and hanging from the case. The wrapping was not damaged in any way, so the case was damaged when it was sent. Also, the tools do not stay in place when the case is closed.\n",
      "However, his frequent use has caused the need to launder the cover three times now. I laundered in cold water and no heat to dry. By the third washing, the zipper seam is coming apart and soon it will be rendered useless. So, good foam, bad cover.\n",
      "I really recommend quinoa if you want energy and strength to last the day, but I don't recommend sand and dirt to be added to the mix, so you might want to avoid this.\n",
      "This game is terrible! Pieces don't want to stand as the cards tell you to set them up. Then you can't hit them with the birds, either it goes entirely too far or not far enough. Totally frustrated an adult can't imagine how frustrated a child would be.\n",
      "Video recording works well but GPS didn't. I emailed the company and was instructed to download the update on their website. I did and it still didn't work! I called the company support and no one ever picks up! I wrote them an email and got a response but they are not very quick at responding. Returning this product and getting something else!\n",
      "I have to admit that the design of this trunk mount rack is at least interesting. First time, I just couldn't believe that it is able to hold 2 bikes. But, yes...it does.<br />In my opinion, the greatest advantage of this trunk mount rack is that it keeps the bikes behind the car and not on top of it, so it you don't have to put too much effort when mounting the bikes. Unfortunately, some effort is required...because my wife wouldn't be able to mount them by herself.<br />The straps are a bit insecure. They could start loosen when driving at higher speeds, so you have to check them once in a while. I don't think that they will loosen completely but it's better to stay on the safer side.\n",
      "My lamp has lasted me 3 years now and still works very well.  It takes longer to charge now, that's undersandable but lamps this affordable I was expecting to duds. But Very good purchase this is.  Highly recommend this\n",
      "I absolutely love the way the desk looks i'm my room. It's classy and simple. The only problem was that the quality wasn't that good, and the drawer is a little unstable. But for this price it's pretty good. All I needed was a little space to do my homework or use my laptop, and this desk is perfect for that.\n",
      "The rug is beautiful, but it's not as luxurious and thick as others I have seen. However, it is also much less expensive than other shag rugs elsewhere. The smell is terrible, but am hoping that it goes away soon.\n",
      "The watch fits me perfectly. I am small to medium boned and it looks just right. It's easy for me to see; the light and. I looked at many and this was really the most perfect one. The band is leather and the watch is worn all the time for dress and work.\n",
      "The camera is awesome, I'm still trying to learn it, but as I use it, I experience a new level of knowledge from the camera. So what I'm saying I love it\n",
      "Love this set, I use it everyday when i take my newborn out places. I don't use the bottle holder though, but that's just me. I Love that this set comes with a changing pad, that's super helpful in bathroom or when I'm over someone's house.\n",

      "A simple, well-made, showerhead at a good price, for those who don't need 8 or more settings. It does the job and does it well. I thought, this shower head would be a rugged functional choice.\n",
      "Avoid this book at any cost. Very amaturely written and a lot of grammatical errors.<br />The least the author can do is at least get the book formatted properly. The typos and and basic capitalization's errors are in your face.<br /><br />Also will give it 2 stars as it can do much better.\n",
      "Very nice product that actually works just like the advertisement says, Very easy to install and not flimsy like some other brands.

      "I understand this is a really cheap tent and I wasn't expecting much from it.<br /><br />Through a couple weekends attempts at hiking though it proved very reliable.<br /><br />it's quick and easy for a single person to pop up and break down.<br /><br />It's light to carry too.<br /><br />It kept me dry which is the main thing.<br /><br />And if I were still inclined to go back out there, it would go with me again.<br /><br />But we are not going back out there.\n",
      ".The graphics are excellent even on my HDMI, large flatscreen 1080i TV, and the sound is actually pretty good.\n",
      "I hate writing bad reviews, but this doesn't work! And for something you spend so much money on, it really should. I hope there's a warranty or something on this. The reverse switch was broken and then, when I ordered a new one, it didn't work AT ALL. This is horrible luck and I really just want a refund and to try another company.\n",
      "The bag is big enough for all the things I carry with me - wallet, kids books and snacks, sunglass case, water bottle etc. I wish there was another pocket inside and that the zipper on top opened a little wider.\n",
      "good rugged design and comfortable.. a worth buy. the color looks good and classy, and can be easily cleaned.\n",
      "The bag looks like a little smaller version than the one in the picture. The picture shows a lot of accessories in the bag and describes how much it holds. I found it hard to accommodate my D3100 and two lenses along with the battery charger. Not much room for much else.\n",
      "I looked all over for this particular type of trim rings like these at an affordable price because I needed 39 of them. These look great in our new log home and I couldn't be happier.\n",
      "I thought the earrings were bigger. at first i was a little disappointed on the size and said it's for an infant or imam give them to my daughter but she already had some so i decided to keep them because it actually looks more expensive and i like that it don't have the plastic on the back. For six pares not bad.\n",
      "I bought the wire to install a new stereo and speaker kit in our boathouse...the kit was supposed to include wire, or so I thought, sadly not the case...the spool at 250 ft, I knew would be sufficient to complete our installation. I found this wire easily managed and to be a common wire rated for home stereo use...very satisfied customer.\n",

      "I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee. These stands are tall enough to hold the car up once the tires are off but you need the jack in place to get the tire off and put it back on. They are really compact and store neatly in my trunk or closet. Can't really beat teh price and they are a one time investment as long as you don't lose them.\n",
      "I was very pleased that I received this bouncer in time for the birthday party. Just sad that I had to pay the shipping because it was going to take too long for site to store. But opened product got it aired up was pretty pleased until we feel the air coming out. When we look at the slide there is a hole in it. We just had to patch and use anyway because it was bought for the party!\n",

      "Nice piece but it is quite heavy. Also, it is much taller than I thought it would be from the photo. If I had looked at the measurements and sized it, I guess I would have had a better feel for what I would be getting.\n",
      "My only concern is the &#34;stuffing&#34; used in the cushions. The thickness is 4&#34; which is ok, but the lasting / endurance of it is questionable. They are EXTREMELY light in weight. Seems like a cheap foam inside. I hope for the price I paid I am wrong and they last.\n",
      "I like it! My girlfriend bought it for me because I'd always just place random cards and cash into my pockets and everything would just get all bent and/or lost. This wallet is nice and thin which was my biggest gripe about never carrying a wallet. sweet!\n",

      "This is the boot every formal weekend hiker I know told me to get.<br /><br />I got it.<br /><br />I regret the price.<br /><br />These are like ice skates in many ways. There is absolutely no give at the ankle. There is no flexibility to the sole.<br /><br />They way they walk in the store is the way the remain after months. Solid, hard, uncompromising.<br /><br />It's like walking with planks of strapped to your feet. Or a cast. It's like a foot/ankle cast.\n",
      "This product is in good condition and came with a packaging. But it's not what I expected. When I saw the product picture and description, I thought and expected the inside has a full-gusseted interior, but it's not. So it was disappointed to me. It will be great to also include an inside image of this product, so customer will know how does the inside look like.\n",

      "At first glance, this may seem like a great ham radio for the price. However, you're dead wrong. This radio barely even works. The buttons are flimsy, and the plastic casing is so fragile that even setting it down carefully could cause it to fall apart. Go get a different radio.\n",
      "I got this for my grandson.  This Teething Necklace has a different variety of shapes for them to chew on.  Which my grandson seems to love very much.  it has helped with the teething some.  The child can also play with the shapes.  This is a pretty decent product.  The only thing I found was that the child could chew through the string and that you need to watch it and check it every time.  Otherwise my grandson loves it and is a good product to have for that teething child.\n",

      "As one previous reviewer pointed out, the question formatting was less than optimal as the questions were at the beginning of each section and subsequently followed by the answers (hard not to cheat). Suggestion - locate the answers at the end of the chapter/text. Also, this may just be me, but the questions should come after the related section's literature not the other way around.<br /><br />Comprehensive but still lacking. When I took the exam I found myself cursing the review book as a great deal of information on the exam was never mentioned in this text. I had to reach into the deep recesses of my mind (sca ry) to retrieve some gray/foggy/probably incorrect information to answer some of the questions. Now, I know that cramming two years of full time graduate study into so many pages isn't feasible. So, I would suggest to future candidates to briefly (and I mean briefly) skim their graduate texts before dedicating majority of their time to this text.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that it was weird to have the practice questions in the beginning of each chapter, and that it doesn't give you a clear idea on how you do on the content unless you're really good at the honor system.<br /><br />What helped me the most were these 2 books<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/SPHR-Exam-Prep-Professional-Resources/dp/0789736764/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1344537422&sr=8-4&keywords=sphr<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BABSJW\n",

      "&#34;I was looking to purchase a sun shade for my daughter and almost bought this one until I did a little more investigating. Since this product has over 70 5 star reviews within a matter of weeks I felt further investigation was in order.<br /><br />I researched the profiles of the reviewers and found a lot of weird &#34;coincidences&#34;. Reviewers leave nothing but 5-star ratings but what's really strange is how different reviewers review the same unrelated products and reviewers review multiple of the same type of product.<br />For example one reviewer reviewed over 20 different iphone cases within a month and all reviews talked about how great it protected their phone. Then you'll see things like 10 different weight loss bottles of Garcinia Cambodia reviewed in the same 2 week span.<br /><br />Just didn't make sense to me so I decided not to purchase this product since the reviews can obviously not be trusted.&#34;\n",

But then somehow it starts getting on he nerves and she is ready to through it into the wall. It's funny to watch her being so frustrated with... herself. But again, I think it makes her more patient with every try. She doesn't quit. Love that there are toys that develop those good qualities in kids.\n",

I can't really tell how long it rotates before it stops. It's really frustrating though because 2 or 3 days later I find my watch stopped then I manually have to shake it and adjust date/time. This device looks good but cheap motor.\n",

      "First, the sockets that came with this set are metric which makes them all but useless to me. Second, that fat round ratcheting swiveling head on the driver makes it very front heavy. It won't matter if you are pointing it downward and turning it but when using it in the horizontal position it can be a real pain.\n",

Here is a small part of the article:<br /><br />&#34;CHINESE MATCHA could have SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES since the lead content in Chinese tea leaves is so high and you are consuming the unfiltered leaf. Be sure to ask where your matcha comes from before you buy.&#34;<br /><br />It's worth checking out the article!<br /><br />BTW, the author also said that: &#34;The Japanese tea leaves did not have any tea leaves that exceeded the limit.&#34;<br /><br />I think Japanese matcha is healthier. I thought you might find this article useful.\n",

      "The lighter has some heft to it, the case is a nice brushed aluminum which is appealing... so why go through all the effort to make it sturdy and then put a plastic tip on the end to hold the igniter?!<br /><br />The tip will melt, mine made it through the original tank of gas and half of a second before it wouldn't light as the igniter tip has melted into the cap.<br /><br />Yes, the igniter needs to be insulated from the aluminum body of the lighter however silicone or a better designed tip should be a no brainier for a lighter that is $10+ dollars.\n",

      "When I first got the headset it worked perfectly.  I could not believe that they only needed to be charged once a week.  After 15 days of use my Samsung 4 and the headset are dropping the Bluetooth connection when the phone is in my pocket and the headset is around my neck.<br /><br />I have tried everything reboot phone, shut off headset, charge head set, charge phone.  nothing seems to work.  this happens in my home where it used to work fine.  I have to give it one star because it should work over 15 days.  The company must know there is a problem.<br /><br />You will see others that have the same problem with the headset.  Now for the hassle of returning.\n",

      "A little bigger than I thought but it works well enough. The bits do not like staying in their holder and the supplied socket set is a little small compared to the handle. Did not pay that much so I can not complain much - would have been a different story if I had paid list price.\n",
      "This cover comes in great colors (I picked the green one) and it looks good. I didn't have this product for long enough to judge how sturdy and durable it's going to be. Read more<br />Published 2 months ago by Noemi ,this is not a perfect product\n",

      "I am in the middle about this table. While it is very sturdy the picture shows a table with six chairs (which is what we ordered) but the table is only large enough for four chairs. The table top also came with a slight ding on the top. The chairs that go with the table are beautiful and quite sturdy though.\n",
      "This battery is terrible. It does not stay charged. It only stays charged for a hour at a time. Horrible.It is one of $0.50 china copies\n",
      "This was my first time using Chemical Guys products and I was pleasantly surprised. The cleaners work well and leave your car nice and squeaky clean. The citrus cleaner is the best cleaner, good for washing the car the day you plan to wax it. The gloss-works is best for cleaning a lightly soiled car, but does leave it wetter looking than the other washes. The big jug which I guess is a mix of the two runs right down the middle on cleaning power and gloss. The gloves are of good quality, particularly the microfiber glove. Those tend to fall apart or mold quickly here in Florida, but this one is still going strong.<br /><br />But the foam sprayer is of poor quality.<br />When this thing worked, it was great and I plan to buy another one, but will seek out a different brand. When I first got it, there was a missing part on the foamer (the hose/strainer that sucks up the soap). I called chemical guys directly to see if they would send me a replacement. They were very friendly and sent me one at no cost that arrived in only a few days. I was pretty impressed since I had actually purchased this through a third party vendor. The foamer worked like a champ for the first couple of months, but started leaking shortly after that. Then, the trigger started sticking so you couldn't stop the flow of foam.

      "Comprehensive but still lacking. When I took the exam I found myself cursing the review book as a great deal of information on the exam was never mentioned in this text. I had to reach into the deep recesses of my mind (scary) to retrieve some gray/foggy/probably incorrect information to answer some of the questions. Now, I know that cramming two years of full time graduate study into so many pages isn't feasible. So, I would sugg est to future candidates to briefly (and I mean briefly) skim their graduate texts before dedicating majority of their time to this text.<br /><br />What i used to study were these 2 books:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Phlebotomy-Worktext-Procedures-Manual-2e/dp/1416000356/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1344539095&sr=8-6&keywords=Phlebotomy<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PJF9LY\n",

      "Very disappointing. The author chose not to use quotation marks which seemed weird to me, especially with so much inner dialogue. Sometime I didn't know if the main character was speaking or thinking and had to re-read in several spots.  It just seems lazy to me and I don't understand why someone would use this format. That's not why I'm giving the book 2 stars though. The author seemed to create a fairly realistic world, but then totally dropped the ball in several spots.  For instance it seemed like nearly every character spoke like a redneck. Maybe the author is implying that only the rednecks will survive... Ha ha, but I don't know. The girl, a 15 year old that can't even remember what the world was like before it all happened leads me to believe it's been at least 10 years, yet she is able to find cheese crackers on a shelf in a store. I'm pretty sure that after 10 years there would be no food on the shelf and it certainly wouldn't be eatable. She was also fortunate to find Coke in a few occasions. Never Pepsi or Dr. Pepper.  The most unrealistic thing about the book was that she was driving all over the country filling up her gas tank whenever she ran low.  I found this totally unbelievable since most gas stations would be empty after 10 hours, but here she is 10 years later.  Anyway, the story was just okay, I liked the 15 year old girl and even cheered for her. Several characters I could see clearly in my mind.  The author has talent and I enjoyed his descriptive writing style, just not the story.  I had to force myself to finish and I didn't like the ending.\n",
      "Within just two days of hooking these lights up, we had three bulbs go out on us. I could understand if we had used them for hours on end, but we only got a couple hours in before this happened. I don't know if it was just a defective set, but this was a little frustrating for us.\n",

      "Swim caps in general are a terrible contraption. They are ugly and tight and horrible. That doesn't mean I don't need one so I always look out for the best one there is. I hate the tightness of the swim cap above all. This is why I found this cap from swimculture and decided to try it out. I can't really go to the pool without a cap, because they put lots of chlorine in the waters. It's because so many people visit the pool I bet and many of them are ladies that would clog the whole place up with all the hair.<br /><br />I like this cap because it is very elastic at least. I still look just as ridiculous like all people wearing swim caps (like an alien), but at least I am more comfortable than most of them. My cap is totally smooth and sleek black, so it doesn't draw any attention. My ears and head didn't hurt at all after wearing my cap, so you can see that it is very elastic and nice to wear. If you absolutely have to wear a swim cap at least buy one that is comfortable like this one on this site.\n",
      "Way too big and bulky for what I need. It was meant to be more as a stylish book-bag than anything else. My dad is going to have to get something else for his birthday, because this certainly isn't something I can see him carrying around. What a bummer. I hope they'll give me my money back.\n",
      "The bike came in a rather small box for it's size which surprised me, as it had to be partially assembled. The problem was that there were numerous small nicks and scratches all over the bike. None were very big, but for being brand new, there shouldn't be any.\n",

      "The charging is great, the usb hub is great, the stand works great and doesn't fall over but the fans aren't exactly placed well at all. Instead of pulling the hot air out of the ps4 it blows it back in, while the console is already trying to push the hot a or out so, hot air gets trapped inside of your PlayStation and your console will overheat. My ps4 actually broke because of this reason. But if you open up the stand and flip the fans around it fixes the problem. So do not turn the fans on unless you have flipped them around or else it will ruin your PlayStation and costs $150 to send it to Sony for repairs. But aside from that it's really great and I will continue to use it once my ps4 is shipped back to me!!!\n",

      "Not sure what to make of this one. I would like to believe the author, but he just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth with the ego he has. Maybe being a Dr. this is just how he sees himself. I gave it 3 stars because I just do not know if it is true or not. I feel that maybe the author just needed a new way to make money but I can admit I could be wrong. Judge for yourself is my best advice.\n",
      "Yes, it's flimsy. Very flimsy, as a matter of fact. But it still does what its supposed to do so I don't really care about the quality. I mean, it's very cheap...I didn't expect too much.\n",

      "I was sent this and [[ASIN:B00VUHJUDK another solar powered outdoor light]] and neither one managed to last longer than three days. It was a bit tricky to get this set up, but I managed to get it situated near my front door and the first evening I was amazed by it--both the motion sensor and the *sound* sensor actually worked. Loved that I could walk up to my front door, rattle my keys near it and it would just turn on. I believe that had to be the coolest feature I'd ever seen on a light. However, it was shortlived because it stopped working properly on the second night. (The other died on the third night.)<br /><br />I first noticed that the sound detection wasn't working properly, although the motion detection was. I didn't think much of it because I could live with it even without the sound detection. By the end of the week, the light stopped working entirely. To make sure it wasn't just in a bad location, I cleaned the solar panel and deliberately put it out in the sunniest location on my property I could find, and since I'm in Florida, we have no shortage of sunlight. Still, no love.<br /><br />It was great while it lasted, unfortunately it just didn't last very long.\n",

      "Used this for only a week and I can't use it any more because it rubs against my arm as soon as I start running. It was bearable, though irritating, at first, but when I ran 6 miles yesterday, I have been in severe pain since then. Just putting on a shirt is painful due to the inflammation on the skin. The material is way too sticky and thick with very little breathing room. Didn't work out as I had expected.\n",

      "A few months ago I had just gotten the Xbox One and wanted a quality headset to go with it. I owned Turtle Beaches before with my Xbox 360 and decided to be a returning customer.<br /><br />My old headset was comfortable and worked well, I loved the bass you could hear with them.<br /><br />When I tried these I was definitely unhappy... The speakers would make an unbearable noise that sounded like rattling most of the time, even at lower volumes. If this wasn't bad enough, one speaker kept cutting out. I had to bang on the side to get it to start working again.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't enjoy these and can't imagine why they are charging so much for them.<br /><br />After this depressing experience I did some serious research and found a headset I absolutely LOVE.<br /><br />It's been over a month and I can't find anything to complain about. The sound and bass is great and I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort.<br /><br />I got them on Amazon actually -------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qwkjUH<br /><br />Even if they aren't the ones for you, I hope I could help share my story with this pair.\n",

      "I have had years of professional experience in testing batteries, from aerospace to hearing aid batteries. I know how to test batteries & I have the equipment. I tested these based on the standard slow 20 hour discharge rate, not a high rate which makes the batteries look even worse.<br /><br />This battery company is basically running something like a scam. I bought a total of 6 of these at 2 different times. My tests show that on average, they don't even measure up to a 1/3 of the 3000 mAh level claimed by UltraFire. One went totally dead after using only once.<br /><br />Furthermore, they only have about the same power level as found in a triple pack of AAA batteries.<br /><br />Therefore, buying these batteries makes no sense at all. Save yourself time & trouble & stay with lights that use the triple pack of AAA batteries. Keep it simple......\n",
      "Actually the belief that \"Hell is for Real\" isn't a funny matter. It's devastating for many children (and adults). Most people who suffer from depression and bipolar disorder have a fixation on the idea of eternal pain.<br /><br />Fear of Hell is the price most Christians pay for accepting the promises of Jesus. You can't have one without the other. This book focuses on the culmination of Jesus' threats. There is another book that describes the lifelong affect those threats have on a young man. It serves well as counterpoint to \"Hell Is for Real.\"<br /><br />\"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" is the autobiography of a very peculiar person who tries to commit the unforgivable sin to escape the threats of Jesus. In it the author describes the messes he gets into trying to rid himself of his decades long fear of Hell. The story should interest similarly peculiar people among many others.<br /><br />\"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" starts with a barrage of shocking blasphemies once shouted by the author at the lunch-breaking denizens of the Congressional office buildings in Washington,, D.C. After a series of adventures, the author reconciles himself with God, who delivers him from his conscience and every other vestige of morality. The author is then free to commit suicide, a fate he has longed for since childhood. In the end the happy author is \"a man on a ledge enjoying the fresh air.\"\n",
      "I never think that we can gain much knowledge from Nature until I read this book. There are such a large number of incredible lessons of how we ought to carry on with our life the way we are intended to live. It is a short book yet notwithstanding it being so concise, it has taught us the genuine significance of life. I truly like the thought that the writer introduces in his book of how human race is worried about their life and how each of us is in a rodent race, what he calls, throughout today's life. In the wake of perusing this book, I had the capacity carry on with my life at the fullest and understood the easily overlooked details that we have a tendency to overlook and pass up a major opportunity in our occupied routine are the genuine satisfaction of life.  My just concern in regards to this book is that it required about more human related illustrations and less creature related ones. Yet other than that, this book shows us the things you would not typically get the chance to learn. So 3 stars from me.\n",

      "This charger worked great a couple of months. Then, it started to take a lot of time to recharge the battery to 100%. Now, after 6-7 hours my phone is just 80% recharged. At the beginning I thought that the charger itself has issues, but, when connecting the phone to my laptop, through this cable, it doesn't recharge well, either: the same problem...after 6-7 hours it stops recharging even if it has reached the level of 80%.<br />I tried to recharge my phone with a standard Samsung charger (without USB cable), and the recharge level easily gets to 100%.<br />So, in my opinion, the cable is the source of all problems.\n",

      "These earring were larger than expected. I have a similar pair in silver and they are much smaller.This item/ product description did not have photo with the model wearing the earrings.

I would say that while they are pretty they do look like costume jewelry.\n",
      "I received this free from Hasbro and my daughter was thrilled to get it!<br /><br />It does come with a lot of pieces, however, most of these pieces are itty bitty tiny pieces that are referred to as &#34;deco pieces&#34;. They pop into the walls but only on on side. She didn't seem to mind that much though. I thought it was a bit strange after I finally figured out it is one-sided holes.<br /><br />The second thing about this set that sticks out is the sink that comes with it. It is cute and the idea is great and all, but it doesn't seem to have much use. My 6-yr-old daughter plays as if it isn't there. She does like the mask that came with the Little Pet Shop set. I was surprised that it actually does stay on the pet!<br /><br />The last thing about it that I have noticed - The wall mount on the bottom right (which is small cardboard) doesn't flatten out well so you can't really sit anything on it. I am unsure why they included this small &#34;surprise&#34; instead of just including a small side table or long-standing table.<br /><br />I would still recommend this to other parents but not without telling them about these things just in case. I was a bit disappoint by this set.\n",

      "I bought this bike headlight from another online vendor and was greatly anticipating its arrival. The light only took 2 maybe 3 days to get here but it did not work. The box itself looks like it had taken quite a beating during shipping, so this may have lead to my light not working, I can't be sure. But the online vendor I bought it from did not respond to my requests for a refund. I eventually found the manufacturer here on amazon and just as a last ditch effort sent them a message explaining my plight. To my surprise I received a phone call from a  real live human being the next day! He was extremely congenial and apologized for my recent experience and assured me I had either received a defective unit or that it was indeed damaged on its way to me. He offered to replace it with no further questions and I was really surprised - needless to say I can't rate the headlight itself yet, but I wanted to post SOMETHING now and once I get the replacement I will update my review. Kudos to a company that still displays a little old fashioned customer service.\n",

Not sure if we got a defective product or what, but after 4 sets of batteries, its now in its final resting place – the upstairs closet toy box.<br /><br />And actually thinking back now, she actually was getting frustrated by this thing, it just goes straight, and back, but when it backs up it does so at an angle, I assume to go in a different direction, THIS is the frustrating part. Unless your child is using this in a 1000 square foot room that is all hard flooring and NO furniture, and assuming you child has the patience of Gandhi, this thing will just reverse into something, then you can only go forward, which again, bangs into something else, then reverse, at an angle, and then bangs into something again, and so the cycle continues till your child will probably run over to it and turn it in the direction to go straight again, unless they have brains of an adult and actually understands how to maneuver it, which is highly unlikely.

      "I received the product. Are happy to try the product. Thank you.<br />If the opportunity we will buy again.\n",
      "Constantly has to be updated or it will NOT pick up satellites, so before trekking out, make sure you update this thing or else its just a brick. Returned. SEE YA!\n",

      "I got this hoping to get a decent set at home but it didn't turn out that way. First, the smell of this set is nothing short of toxic. The chemical smell they come with is nauseating and fills an entire room. I tried wiping them down but it didn't seem to help and after some inspection noticed there was a warning label about the chemicals used being linked to cancer and birth defects. Also, the kit doesn't even come with enough weight to even reach 40 lbs. I weighed all the weights and they equal 38 lbs, which is with the 4 lb bar itself.<br /><br />After getting rid of these I got myself a set of dumbbells I absolutely love. I got them around a month ago and I can't find a single thing to complain about. The max weight and combination of weights included are endless. I'm so happy I bought the set.<br /><br />If you want a quality set of dumbbells, then get the same set I did here on Amazon ---------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1r0BiNN<br /><br />I hope I could help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did!\n",
      "I bought the Nautica chronograph N14536G a couple of days ago. Prompt delivery. Received the watch in good condition. The watch itself looks as good as it does on the screen... a good, solid watch... sporty looks and feel. Some might think it is heavy, which it probably is, but I have no problems there. My main complain is that the manual that comes with the watch is useless... does not have specifications/ help for this particular model. Also the seconds hand is the tiny dial at the 6 O'Clock position and the main \"seconds\" dial is for the stop watch, which I find weird in a watch.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a good buy, if you don't mind a heavy watch. I even got a pair of Nautica binoculars free!! And no one can beat Amazon's price.\n",
      "It's a piece of junk!  My son had seen the commercials for what looked like such a fun and exciting new toy. I was thrilled to find one at Target. It ended up being such a let down....My son's spirits were as deflated as this stupid balloon.  I bought one at Target (for a fraction of the cost that people are asking on Amazon and eBay). I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed. Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable. NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles. How convenient! They include a note: \"Lifetime replacement warranty\" \"Do not return to the retailer.\" Only problem, they want $7 \"handling fee.\" Plus the cost of postage to mail it back, which ended up costing me another $5. So, that was a total of $12 to get a replacement.\n",

Thanks for providing a quality product.\n",

      "Absolutely love this bag. Have received many compliments about this bag and wanting to know where I purchased it. This bag was so much cheaper than in the stores. The zipper tag did rip when I pulled on it. Awesome construction otherwise.\n",

      "Overall has a great appearance, much nicer than anything at the big box stores. The only negatives would be regarding installation. The bolts included are rather short so took some modification to fit properly in my ceiling box. Also the base is very small and does not quite cover the hole in my ceiling.\n",
      "This is a good hose for everyday gardening and you really don't need anything else if your only goal is to keep your plants watered and alive. Just be sure to know which option is which since you don't want sprouts to fly off the pot when you accidentally use jet. Trust me, I know.\n",

The next two times I used the machine in just a few inches of snow it did not clean down to the concrete -- it left a thin layer (now packed) of snow behind.

      "My baby only weighs 15 lbs and is 5 months old and the swing is already broke. Something in the motor went bad. It was an amazing swing until that happened. I didn't run it all day. I used it for about an hour or two a day. I wouldn't recommend spending this kind of money on something that breaks in five months.\n",

I had to look for another one since my evenings couldn't be complete without a game or two.

In a few days, i had the adapter at hand and has been well satisfied by the good work it does.\n",

      "I can't believe what a piece of junk this chair turned out to be……so disappointed. I was so excited when I purchased this chair but was let down pretty fast when I opened the box. The seat was fine…..could be better quality material but I was willing to overlook that. The main thing that got me mad was that 1 of the legs was broken already! After I was given a replacement set of legs……they broke after about 3 weeks!!! I would strongly advise against this product.\n",

      "If you like detailed work this is the dollhouse for you. It took forever to put this kit together. The wood was very thin. Some of the tabs did not fit into the slots. I wish I would have purchased a different brand of dollhouse. Save your money. I wish I did.\n",

      "I ordered this mattress for my son based solely on the reviews at the time. Eleven out of 11 gave five stars. Unfortunately after two nights he went back to his old mattress b/c he said the 6 inch foam was not dense enough and he felt like he was laying on the box spring.\n",

      "I like this clock because it's easy to set and it's nice and loud which suits me well because I normally have a hard time waking up in the morning. I hate the fact that it docent keep accurate time.

      "The rings are advertised as for 1\" scope tubes but they have cloth inserts inside the rings to make them tighten up on 1\" rings. At first I thought the cloth inserts were just protective but the rings wouldn't completely tighten down on the 1\" scope tube without the cloth insert present. They are glued in and even the glue job was weak.\n",
      "I purchased this TV last month as a living room TV. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret buying it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming very quickly as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, one of the HDMI ports proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. I tried to deal with it for as long as I could but then decided this wasn't what I paid for.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for much CHEAPER!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 60 inch TV, check this one out here on Amazon -------&#62; http://amzn.to/1ozWTLS<br /><br />I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here.

      "I don't like these because they do not seal. They just sit on top of the bowl like a piece of floppy plastic. To make sure it was the lid and not the bowl I tried it over multiple kinds of bowls. The only use I have for these is to cover things before I put them in the microwave.\n",
      "My husband is a hard man to please when it comes to video games. He usually sticks to PC gaming, but every now and then he will chance upon something that draws him away from the computer. Rune Factory 4 did just that.<br /><br />What he loves about this game:<br /><br />Harvest Moon style farming<br />Auto leveling skills<br />Simple RPG format<br />Quests<br />Hack and Slash features<br />Ability to obtain monsters<br />Upgrades to your town and farm<br />RPG style equipment<br /><br />So far it seems like the perfect blend for him.

      "These are applied the exterior glass on your car and the manufacturer claims that they can dramatically improve you wet weather driving visibility without window wipers. Well, I don't know about dramatically but they certainly do improve the visibility through windows when wet weather driving.<br /><br />I must say I was impressed with how easy it is to install. When we had a down pour recently I hardly had to use the wipers. One thing to note however, don't put this on your side windows as I did  because you will have all the water rushing in if you crack them open for any reason.<br /><br />This even works on glass shower doors and stops them from steaming up as frequently, which reduces how often I have to clean the shower.\n",

      "My kitten got ring worm that I needed to treat.  He was a shelter cat, so I guess this wasn't unexpected.  I got this and bathed him three times with it.

I am very pleased.\n",

They looked great out of the package but as soon as I washed them little balls of material formed on the sheets and it was then that I was reminded of WHY I Don't buy sheets online. Bummer. :(\n",
      "I really wasted my money on this. I wanted a new look for my living room. But sloppy wasn't it. This thing will not stay on. It bags out and creates a roll that my 2yr old used as a hammock. Never again! I went & bought a new couch instead.\n",
      "Picked this out as a Christmas gift for myself and my husband purchased it for me. It work great for just over a year, and the speakers have quit working.

      "This steam cleaner has absolutely zero suction and is completely worthless except to get your carpet wet and letting it dry on its own. You can tell for sure, besides the stains still remaining, when you try to dump the dirty water and there is next to none. Thank goodness the price isn't outrageous.\n",
      "So the light cast from this is very bluish, which might be ok for reading but is not good just as a table lamp to light up part of a room. Also unless you put your book within inches of the lamp, it is useless, even on high power. So setting it on a table next to a couch to read is useless as is setting it on a bedside table to read by.\n",
      "The TV we received was slightly used, possibly, with fingerprints across the top of the screen as well as screws stripped on the stand. The picture had a bright background and just didn't measure up to our 40\"Samsung TV. While the price was great, we would not recommend Sharp to anyone RIGHT NOW.\n",

      "I got this collar because of the 5 star glowing reviews.  Turns out to be a dud.  The collar quit working after a single use and it wasn't mishandled by the dog.  It will no longer charge nor turns on.  Don't be fooled like me.  The five star reviews are probably fake reviews made up by the company.  I guess I'm such a sucker.\n",

      "This rug has a nice design and nice colors, but it is literally paper thing. When you put it on the floor, it doesn't even lay flat because it's not heavy enough to. I'm definitely returning the one I ordered online.\n",

There appears to be a password on it that we can not figure out. After hours of frustration I finally had to take it to a computer tech to be reformatted. Would not recommend this to anyone.\n",
      "This is a great bookshelf for the price. It does not hold all my books but it's fine. I only use the last 3 tiers as bookshelf. I use the 2 upper shelves for other stuff. It looks good on my room too. The design and the make is perfect for me.\n",
      "This product arrived looking just gorgeous. So very shiny and bright. I put my pendant piece on it, (which I purchased the chain for, BTW) and I was initially unsure whether they looked okay together, as my diamond/heart-shaped piece could not compare to the shine of the chain, INITIALLY anyway. After a few, (maybe 2-3 months) of use, the shine and sparkle quickly faded and became dull and quite frankly, embarrassing to wear. I am not usually disappointed with my jewelry from them, but this was just that, a BIG disappointment! Sorry about the review, but felt I needed to be honest; after all, I also depend on the reviews when shopping online.\n",
      "The grill looks great and is easy to assemble. The instructions for use are easy to understand. Unfortunately the grill doesn't get hot enough to sear the meat even when preheated for quite some time.\n",

      "I have to say that one has to be very careful not to leave streaks. Basically I have to use one cloth for cleaning and another one for drying the windshield, if I let it dry by itself I get nasty streaks.\n",
      "I think this hat is very adorable. It is great for playing dress up or having a photo booth at home or for parties. My head must be a little larger than most because it didn't cover my head the way the picture shows. It fit my children's heads just fine tho. It is fun to put it on while reading little red riding hood to the kids and changing up the voices. It's fun to add that kind of character to reading time!\n",
      "Item was not worth the price I paid. Maybe if bracelet was free with free shipping, then maybe it would've been worth it. Very cheaply made.\n",
      "Got this sleeping bag for a camping trip and the first time I went to use it the zipper broke. I tried re-zipping it and it continued to break over and over. It may be a manufacturer's defect, I'm not sure. I would not recommend this product to anyone and will not buy from this company again.\n",
      "Rusted in first week of use. I was charged a large restocking fee to return even though it was defective.\n",
      "Bought this dresser for my new granddaughter's clothes. It arrived in record time, no problem. The backing is just cardboard and the rails that hold the drawers in are plastic.\n",
      "Exactly what I expected. No surprises. Fit exactly as they should.<br />One thing I was not expecting was the softness of the waistband.<br />Honestly I was going for quantity not quality but I am very happy with these.\n",
      "I have had a real issue with these goggles staying on. It doesn't adjust correctly and has poor quality.\n",
      "The volume was to low even when you had it on the highest setting. But all the other feature where pretty good. I decided to return it and just buy a video one felt more secure to be able to see my son instead of just hearing him.\n",
      "This water filter straw is a great thing to have when you go out for hiking, camping or back packpacking.  It's light weight. you can hang it from your neck.<br /><br />I have had to use my straw filter in a few camping trips, for demonstration purposes.  They had disgusting looks on my face while i was trying to sip out of a murky pond.  I didn't worry.  This revomes all water born bacteria.  in a few seconds, I already had clean drinking water.<br /><br />I also keep on stored at home.  For emergency purposes.  Hope nothing bad happens but you'll never know. There's not shelf life on this product anyway.\n",
      "I have a single speed bike with a steel frame and it weighs about 15 kilos. The rack was easy to install and it had no problem holding up my bike. I just got a 2 because my girlfriend's moving in and she has a mountain bike. I don't think it'll have any problems with holding up 2 bikes, but I'll just have to wait and see.\n",
      "Good quality for the money.  This flag is for the display cabinet at work. Looks good but I don't know how it will hold up yet.\n",
      "I love to feed my kids with goat milk. But to buy it fresh from the farm is so expensive, so this is a great substitute. I started my kids on this when I stopped nursing and they've loved it ever since. They eat it in their cereal and drink it straight from the cup. I think goat's milk is the next best thing to breast milk!\n",
      "I love this key ring it is leather made of very high quality, durable will last for a really long time\n",
      "I was hoping this would be as good as it sounded, but I was very disappointed. It was purchased to use for camping. It was charged for 36 hours per instruction and it worked really well blowing up one of our air mattress but half way through the second it kept cutting out, it would not even work for the third.\n",
      "Have had the controller less than 1 months and the controller doesn't hold charge. Also knob sticks are falling apart. Would not recommend this product.\n",
      "Does not come with any Bluetooth shutter button. It was impossible for me to take the shot with the stick extended and out of my reach. Wish the package would include a shutter button instead of forcing you to purchase separately for more money. Gave me the feeling I've received an incomplete product that does not work to its full potential\n",
      "have Pisector for a week now in my house it seems to be working fine,its very easy to install but i did use the mounting screws for added security to the door.so far I am really liking this product. i like that I am not stuck in contract and that I could install it myself. I would recomend this to friednds and family for sure.\n",
      "I have travelled with this bag to few countries since I bought it for first time last year. It has plenty of space to keep lots of things in it and it is strong too. I have purchased two more few days ago for my next trip.\n",
      "I should have bought a ps3 remote, instead. This works as advertised, yes. However the directional buttons are a little finicky, and the options as a universal remote are pretty limited.\n",
      "I'm sorry, I found this movie kind of boring. So boring in fact that I didn't finish it. Instead, I went to my cupboard and got out \"The Big Chill.\" Now that's a reunion movie. That's a movie with characters you care about. There were no characters in this one that I cared enough about to keep watching. I made it about halfway, then quit. If there was a story or a plot, I missed it.\n",
      "Terrible product and very cheaply made.  Save your money and buy a quality peeler ... buy UberChef!!!!\n",
      "After reading the other reviews on this item I ordered it and was excited to receive it. Boy was I disappointed. I expected it dirty as others had said it was when they received it but didn't expect it to be as dirty as it was. The smell was also very strong.\n",
      "The plastic of the controller's body is so thin that the light from the red indicator lights near the charging port in the back bleeds through the plastic. This is only a cosmetic problem, but I feel like they should have at least reinforced the area with a strip of electrical tape or foil that would block the light. These controllers are too expensive to have cosmetic defects.\n",
      "I returned the unit because when I saw it, I realized that it was not what I wanted. What I wanted was an inexpensive, entry level receiver with surround sound & speakers. This unit, like so many others, was a DVD player with a radio. I returned it without ever using it.\n",
      "Disclaimer: This looks really nice on me and it may seem large for my head but it is adjustable<br /><br />I am a fan of hats and caps although this made me kinda guy looking but still it worked great on me. My husband can use it as well and I think although it did not indicate that it is unisex, it really is. The material used or the fabric is cotton and I like the color which is suitable for most sporty attire. I am gonna use this more specially  now that summer is almost here. It can be great protection for the face plus it looks cool for me.\n",
      "Just like everyone else, my bulb burnt out in my TV, I decided to go with this brand of replacement bulb for the great price, even though it had mixed reviews.<br /><br />The bulb only lasted two days before burning out. Returning the bulb was a hassle and not worth the time. I got my refund and went with a different bulb here on Amazon that STILL WORKS after three months. I was so relieved to not have to worry about being able to watch my TV or not.<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY replacement lamp, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1kyLOcy<br /><br />It is nearly the same price and is on Amazon as well, trust me you won't be dissappointed!!!\n",
      "It's too bad we can't buy this item at the store. Its sturdy construction and double canopy make it ideal for my city walks. It's compact design makes it easy to carry. This was exactly what I hoped to find.\n",
      "the water spray is not nice and uniform like the others but that isn't a huge deal. the real problem is the new unit leaks.\n",
      "One 'pole' broke on set up, the plastic snapped at one of the hinges. This was day one of a 5 day trip. Then the plastic snaps that hold the tempt material to the poles kept breaking on take down. I think only 3 remain in one piece. We had to continue to modify and make do on the go.\n",
      "Great briefcase that is modern for the young professional. The only qualm I have with this briefcase is that it does not have dividers for your papers and folders, although there is a front pocket for those kinds of things. Other than that, it is a perfect product and is highly recommended by me.\n",
      "I bought this shower curtain about a year ago. And it is completely rusted. I'm sorry but I believe a product that is meant for your shower, where it is going to get wet should not rust. It looks absolutely horrible.\n",
      "I had two black bar stools and I was looking for the perfect bar height table to go with them for my new apartment. I had limited space to work with and I just wanted something simple and practical.\n",
      "Light and small to carry around while cycling, but however too small to lock wheels too. I got my front wheel stolen because it was not locked to the ramp, and it was apparently very easy to disemble.\n",
      "The size of this is good. The strap is also nice and sturdy. The smooth finish combined with the light color give the bag a rather, well, it looks like vinyl. The clasp is a bit on the cheap side and looks like it can't be replaced if broken.\n",
      "These gloves are a great fit and allow ample feeling in the finger tips and these gloves also allow you to work without taking them off all the time.\n",
      "I bought this item as a gift for my grandson's new bed. Sent it to another State and when my daughter tried to put it together, it had two left rails. She brought it back to a near her, but it was not in stock. Unfortunately, she had to settle for another bedrail. She was not pleased.\n",
      "After washing this mug, all I'm left with now is an ordinary black piece. The image is gone and so is the part that made this mug worth buying in the first place.\n",
      "All but 2 of the bags were significantly underweight. I felt like everytime I threw the bags, the wind was pushing them because they were too light!!! I got these as a gift and didn't have the heart to ask how I could return them. I'll keep them as a backup, but I immediately went out and bought a new set.\n",
      "I did receive one broken piece but luckily it was a piece that is not seen and was repaired with gorilla glue. It was very time consuming to put together. Overall it is a beautiful piece of furniture.\n",
      "I finally after all these years found a fragrance that I dearly loved. What in the world has happened to them? No smell at all and I use to get compliments on these, but no more. Too much money for watered down products.\n",
      "Yes, I am that and I'm proud of it. Watching the original series of Star Trek on Blu-ray is an experience that no fan should miss out on, regardless of their prejudices.\n",
      "The video quality and performance were pretty good. And I would have dealt with it, had the wireless functionality actually worked. Trying to connect WPA2-PSK doesn't work. And that is the main function I needed it for.\n",
      "Four THUMBS because both my wife and I use the hose and we like to post about products that actually do work the way they promise it will.\n",
      "My dog eats these pretty fast. He's about 60 pounds so he is the kind of big dog who will eat anything. I must say that they also don't stink like a lot of pet food products. I also trust the milk bones because it is a reputable brand.\n",
      "Thing scratched up my console! I deeply regret the purchase, I couldn't believe my eyes, the entire point was to protect it! So angry right now.\n",
      "I have had this for about a month and love it....I am still learning all of the features but I have to say that this is the best camera I have owned. The images are very clear and bright,  zoom is fast and so is shutter time. I also like the pet photo function.\n",
      "This movie was not as good as the other animated films that came out this year (Monsters University and Despicable Me 2) but still a great movie for the kids. It has a unique story as snails are really slow but in this they bent reality. Kids love it but it wasn't enough for me.\n",
      "This thing is amazing! I know all these fancy diaper bags out there could almost change your baby for you, but none is as visually awesome as this one! We love it so much that not only does my husband carry it, I carry it too!\n",
      "I like this bag, very nice shape and useful size. I like a bag with one large compartment, not all different dividers inside. Will be good for traveling, matches the duffle I also got in Latte. BUT.....it is way overpriced unless it is on sale! Glad I got it then. I won't recorder till it's on sale again, sorry!\n",
      "The audio quality from this microphone is amazing. I use it mostly for recording some really bad singing but my voice almost sounds tolerable when I used this microphone.\n",
      "I like the color and the size is okay for the price. The subtle metallic sparkle is a nice touch. Speaking of touch it feels good on bare feet. Adds coziness and style. If it had padding on the bottom I'd give it 5 stars, but know that it was slip all around on the floor without carpet tape.\n",
      "This was a Christmas gift for my son's girlfriend and I love the charm. The chain that came with it was cheap but the price is good for the charm. I ordered another chain and it looks beautiful.\n",
      "Was expecting this one is durable but when it arrived, I realized it is very flimsy. The quality or materials used is cheap, really cheaply made. The pocket or compartment sizes are not good also. Really not working for me.\n",
      "This is the perfect size for my 6 year old son. He loves it but we wish the battery would last a little longer. I guess thats just the reality of having an electric powered toy, or maybe there is something wrong with ours...\n",
      "I purchased this kind of case with regard to my personal camera, it really is ideal and it has a great high quality. Just a little bit small I guess but the delivery had been punctually which is ideal.\n",
      "The quality of construction and materials was so nice. And yes, like others reviews, it has a good, not too heavy, weight to it. However, it just didn't fit right. I'm also athletic build/pear shaped. I bought both the small and medium to try both and send the one that didn't fit back.\n",
      "i purchased this polo shirt for my husband and for every detail i requested for was well packed,my man was happy for it,it fits so well!\n",
      "I like that this set comes with 2 speakers. Wattage is OK. The only issue is the short range. Not what I expected from a set of wireless speakers.\n",
      "I used to work with the tools which are being sold by this brand for quite a long time. I noticed that thier quality is not what I could call 'top notch'. Also, I find them a bit too expensive for what they are offering.\n",
      "For only 19 bucks i find this ikea lamp to be a great product. It has a nice design and can sit very well in every corner of a room and get the right light. Cheap and useful!\n",

      "I love my Sony Digital Camera. I chose Sony brand because i have had many Sony products and have been pleased with them. I highly recommend this camera since they gave speedy delivery to my house and that too pleased me!\n",
      "I absolutely love this product. From the quality of the product to the way it consistently keeps its form and gives the same great comfort of knowing that my legs are rested on an everyday use. I have a current health condition and these socks are the one to use everyday.\n",
      "This is heavier than my other retractable leash. The spooler occasionally snags which is a problem with a small dog. Either I am dragging the extra leash until I fix it or it is too tight for the dog to extend the leash. It' a good product bot not a perfect one.\n",
      "Bought this for my little boy.l It is very east to play, so I'm sure he enjoys it for that reason. The neck seems fat to me which I like. We put Aquila strings on it right away as the strings it came with seemed a bit cheap.\n",
      "i ordered this for myself thinking they would fit great but when i got them they were hugh . i guess i ordered the wrong size . but after looking them over and putting them on they feel great on my feet . very soft inside and nice and fluffy . they keep my feet nice and warm even though they are way to big . i will most likely give these to my sister for a gift . but over all these are very well made and looks nice .\n",
      "These are my standard daily shades. The new design is a bit smaller but still fits my face good enough.\n",
      "I bought this mat over a year ago and there is still little to no traction. My hands and feet slip all the time and I could see an injury happening because of it. I've never had this problem before and do not recommend this mat.\n",
      "I am writing this review for my wife because she is too nice. I'm nice too, just not happy.<br /><br />We've had a Paderno spiral slicer since 2012 and get great use out of it.<br />Last week we decided to buy a 2nd spiral slicer for the cabin since we are spending more time up there these days. I told my wife to buy this one because of the good reviews, especially the one from top reviewer RWM.<br />We got it and took our usual bunch of vegetables up and besides the softest ones, the Briefton was not capable enough. Just too flimsy and blades not sharp enough. Ruined our dinner and wife blamed me for choosing it of course.<br /><br />We are returning it but it really should have NEVER been ranked equal or higher than the Paderno!<br /><br />Hope his helps others from wasting their time.\n",
      "Decent product, i got what i ordered and what i saw in the picture.<br /><br />No issues with the product, comes in a stylish case..\n",
      "I really was using this when G-oil was giving away those $20 rebates on the 5 qt jug at wally world. It works fine. I have noticed that its thicker than synthetic M-1. My mechanical oil pressure gauge runs 5-7 psi higher on this oil in my F-150 with the same 5w30 weight oil. I have also used it in my V-6 montero as well. I change my oil every 7k miles and normally I have to add 2x as much as normal synthetic (M1, syntec, Val) at 3-4k miles to get me to the 7k change. I definitely notice both my engines consuming more of this oil than normal synthetic. I am from the school of lower viscosity (higher flow oil) and less burning oil so if the price is the same I usually go somewhere else.\n",
      "I have an infant and toddler so I purchased this set so I would have a free hand/arm while traveling. I'm trusting them in the durability of the item since she's a world traveler. I do feel that my Samsonite brand luggage is better quality which is the reason I gave 4 stars.\n",
      "Appears to be of decent quality and the perfect size to protect my external hard drive. I bought a second one to gift to a family member and am pleased with the product.\n",
      "Usually not the type of a movie I'd watch. Surprisingly, it had a few episodes that I found hilarious and was laughing out loud. Overall, pretty entertaining.\n",
      "We don't know what will happen. We don't have the power to predict future events. I always want to make sure that I'm ready with tragedies or any emergency situations. It's hard to neglect this kind of situations. This emergency kit is for two persons and would last for 3 days. It is a complete survival kit.\n",
      "I like to go diving and I wanted to replace an old whistle that I had which had corroded slightly and I purchased the 4 pack so that I could had them around to my close diving companions too.  They loved the fact that they worked well and they could be easily attached to our kit.\n",
      "Most annoying, the small cover that effectively seals the spout would suction itself on once wet and when we tried to pour, water would leak around it or actually cause the lid to fly off and water to go everywhere. We even tried creating a notch in the plastic cover, but to no avail. This one with no cover obviously solves that issue. Only slightly less annoying, the carbon bits that would leak down into the main pitcher. So far, no bits. Two thumbs up.\n",
      "The box made it look really fancy though the design is not really the in thing right now. the gray and midnight blue is fancy-looking and both could be worn for everyday basis. the other 3 or more on for the stylish bachelor preppy look. Great items in total.\n",
      "To me, these earrings looked like any average cubic zirconia jewelry in the silver rack in most department stores. In real life it's a big main stone and the outer circle is smaller than appears in the picture. It does not look like fine jewelry or diamonds. However main stone produces a lot of sparkle and the earrings are sturdy and well done.\n",
      "I love having a dash cam, mostly because I am really, really paranoid. So far, I am impressed with this product. The memory's great and the performance is as promised.\n",
      "I bought 3 of these for beginner players. They aren't that quality but they are nice. The tuner is easy to use the amp is great and the DVD had them playing amazing grace in a couple days. Great price for a nice product.\n",
      "I like the full coverage and how it perfectly fits my back seat. Now we can bring our dogs, small and big, without having to bring their carry cage with them ans w/o having to worry about the interior getting damaged and dirty. It's very well-priced and easy to install and I wouldn't think twice buying another one.\n",
      "These gloves were well worth the money. The leather is nice quality and I was so happy to give these as a gift. They are nicer than gloves I have seen that cost nearly twice as much. I received them quickly and am very pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "This is much better than what I was led to believe, though not that much I have to admit. It's durable though.\n",
      "I hate having to pluck ticks from my dog, but it has to be done, and this product at least makes the task easier. I spent an hour total checking and re-checking, which is actually a lot shorter than what I used to spend.\n",
      "The statue is a very small castled mold not hand sculpted and made of a very flimsy and fragile looking blackened cement or sand-like material not stone. It is not worth half it's price. Very disappointing!\n",
      "I have been playing one of these for a while now. I love it but...  As with most hollow bodies it goes out of tune after heavy string bending leads.  This model IS MUCH MUCH better than most because of its through body solid design, which is why its called a semi-hollow body.  If you dont play bluesy bendy leads this is as good as any guitar out there. If you do. Keep a second 6 string by the stage so when you come out of that solo you are playinbg diminished chords...lmao\n",
      "This is a very cute table and chair set for my kids, they love it. It is sturdy (I sit in the chairs sometimes and I weigh 170lbs) and its very  colorful. My daughter loves this set and she is two years old and my son is 4. thanks for the great buy\n",
      "This is HORRIBLE!!! I ordered two of these gates and the first one was broken. I put the second one up and it wouldn't even open. These aren't made well and they are just really a bad product. VERY disappointed. Don't waste your time or money.\n",
      "The watch itself is a beautiful watch. Love the watches - they last a long time. However, I returned the watch because the diamonds are sooooo small you can't even see them. They are not portrayed as they really are in the picture.\n",
      "The sound quality is really great, however there are instances that audio gain isn't working properly. I don't know if its just my copy but overall I can say that this is a pretty decent recorder for any occasions. I've been using it for wedding videos.\n",
      "As I'm sure the other 6,000 reviews told you, vampires don't sparkle. Actually I'm pretty sure vampires don't exist. Nor do huge wolves which was an obvious attempt on your part to appeal to the native american people in hopes of garnishing their support in making you works reach best seller status.<br /><br />I would suggest you remove these myths from the book, which would shorten the 4 book series to one novella. In fact, if you just had Bella die from her head injury from that volleyball in gym class, we would be spared a lot of unnecessary whining and melodrama, and could go on to enjoy real cult classics like 'Vamp, the alien sex goddess masquerading as Wonder Woman.'<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />your number two and half fan,<br />TheReviewNutt\n",
      "I love the product, the black color matches with my black controller. It has helped me save lots of cash that I was using to purchase batteries that even didn't last for long before dying.\n",
      "Nice looking buffet. Very long. Assembly was time consuming but not difficult. The instructions were clearly laid out. Just make sure you have a lot of space. Bottom drawers stick, but overall quality is good, but not great. Compatible to the PB buffet, but I'm sure PB construction is a bit better.\n",
      "I was very unhappy with this streaming device. It would not connect to my router, so I had to box it up and send it back.\n",
      "I LOVE this water bottle. It can go in the dish washer, it keeps water a little cooler, and it's pretty. My 2 year old daughter and I both have pink. Mine has a little dent but who cares? Best of all, its eco-friendly and it has a wide mouth that fits ice cubes. The water bottles have a small opening and do not fit ice cubes. Buy this bottle for everyone in your family and quit putting plastic bottles in the landfills!\n",
      "this is same game and I want to ask EA why they didn't care to fix glitched trophy's on previous version? So they made a new game and don't care anymore about their customers. Don't buy this until they fix all the things and update older version of this game. I don't trust this company anymore. Shame on you EA\n",
      "i would not buy this set again. it may be lightweight and flimsy so it saves space in the closet. however, it breaks easily and it's  difficult to slip your clothes when hanging them. i don't like it at all.\n",
      "Reasons for my 2 star:<br /><br />1.  Requires battery on the second receiver.<br />2.  Range is not as advertised - I tested and it was about half of what the description says.<br />3.  Tried contacting seller and no answer.\n",
      "This is the FIRST thing I have purchased from here that I did not feel deserved 5 stars. The liner was several inches shorted than stated. The rod had previously been opened and the pieces weren't well situated. Disappointing!\n",
      "Loving the grill mat am very happy camper because it keep my veggie in one place without falling through my griller. Also, love that it keep my meat juicer\n",
      "The low price and the quality of the items is really a eye opener. I was expecting some crappy material but I was wrong. Felt and look like a decent tie you would pay $15+\n",
      "Beautiful desk but the only issue we had was delivery. It was elongated because the driver could not fit based on our schedule. Very frustrating when you are under time constraints.\n",
      "Faulty spout and water line, caused flooding and ruined downstairs ceiling and hardwood floors. Do not buy. Not worth it!!\n",
      "After hesitation from reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and order this tv for our bedroom. All I can say is, chance worth taken. This tv is great! Arrived quickly, in perfect shape and it works just as it should.\n",
      "This movie has the most brutal and graphic violence you are likely to ever see. If you have any question of whether war is inhuman, see this movie to set yourself straight. It chronicles several strangers, forced to waste their lives on a pointless mission. We see how brutal and fruitless war is. The movie shows us good people and bad people (in predictable roles on both sides of the fighting). The direction and filmography are similar to Band of Brothers (for obvious reason). It is technically and visually excellent.<br /><br />The failing of the movie, I believe, is that it can't compare to The Thin Red Line in terms of message(both came out the same year). Although clearly showing that ''war is bad,'' Ryan fails to show us the underlying cause (people, even good people, are corrupt and inhuman). We see bad people do bad things, and good people do good things in this movie. See the Thin Red Line, and feel that not only is war bad, but humanity in general is brutish and terrible.\n",
      "My roommate and I thought that this would be a great idea for making our own burgers but he noticed that this comes with some serious quality issues, not least of which is the weak coating.\n",
      "I bought this to use with a vintage meter less film camera. It's easy to use, and seems very accurate. I've not had it long enough to comment on durability, but it seems OK. The buttons all seem to be tight and to be making the proper contact with their counterparts. That it will also meter for flash brings bonus functionality to the old camera. I'm pleased with how well it works.\n",
      "I bought these in a size 10. I liked the look and quality of the shoe, but they ran a bit small sadly. I was so excited to wear this shoe because it is really pretty, just too tight. Unfortunately have to send them back.\n",
      "The truth is Sega hasn't couldn't escalate after Genesis. In fact, Sonic had to carry them & Nintendo was the one who made Sega popular by being their rival; which Nintendo was & STILL is light years ahead of washed up Sega so it was no comparison.<br /><br />Sega is aware of how crappy their company is cause in the 90s they swore they would never team up with Nintendo; but now they barely make just games instead of garbage systems & even team up with Nintendo so once again Nintendo would save them. The only good game in the Sonic series was Sonic 3+Sonic & Knuckles & that was just average. Sonic 1 was ok but overrated & lacks replay value, Sonic 2 was extremely easy & overrated as well, Sonic 3 was too short & a waste of time. Instead of just going ahead & releasing the full game of Sonic 3, Sega wanted to make a money grab; the other Sonic games pretty much sucked.\n",

      "This is a great wallet! I ordered it in the Athena Bronze and it is beautiful. The zipper is sturdy and there are so many slots for cards. You can fit your phone in there and use it as a clutch too. I am new to Gigi hill and sad to find out that these are the last items released. Will be stocking up because the price for the quality is unbeatable.\n",

      "I aquired this product wanting me and my husband could use it for coffee so we wouldn't should spend so significantly on K-Cups. This doesn't work at all. It makes a terrible cup of coffee.\n",
      "I don't know a lot about neem oil, so I don't know if it's supposed to stink...but it stinks. I bought this to help kill various bugs around my apartment but don't really use it because of...the smell. It did work for getting rid of some flying bugs that infested a hanging plant, but I haven't used it much. Plus, if it gets chilly in your house, it gets solid and you have to put it in hot water for a while to reliquary it.\n",
      "The gauge doesn't work properly! Be very careful using this. Your tires could blow if you put too much air in them. There should be regulations on these or something. I wouldn't recommend this to any of my friends. Find something that's going to be accurate.\n",
      "Each story was more like an odd skit featuring various well known actors/actresses when they were younger or starting out. A curious collection for someone interested in these types of movies. Quality is very poor... Most were very dark and grainy, so difficult to watch. One of the CDs glitches or skipped a little.\n",
      "I kind of hoped the quality of these would be a little better... They are still fun for a party night though...\n",
      "Fits in my trunk really well. Easy to carry, the only thing that I think of is the handle. I hope that it will last long. As for now, this cooler does its job nicely.\n",
      "I am so disappointed with this shopping cart!<br />Its so cheaply made & literally fell apart the first time we put it together. its dangerous for little fingers too, which was a no no for me.<br />Don't waste your time, you'll just have to return it in the end.<br />There are much better ones on amazon for even a better price that made wonderfully.<br />Disappointed!\n",
      "I purchased three of these aprons to embroider for mother's day. Each held up great to a embroidery machine. After, we used paint to put the kids handprints on the aprons. With both paint and embroidery, I was concerned about washing them for the first time. But they held up great to a front loading washing machine.\n",
      "The only problem I have though is that sometimes the puppy likes to swallow it whole and nearly choked twice now. I think I should take it away from him.\n",
      "This is such a cute puppy. I am a little disappointed that it doesn't or can't relax a bit without just being powered off. I thought the barking and all the sounds it makes was cute, but the non stop spinning and jumping and spinning some more is almost to much.\n",
      "This is a beautiful shower curtain rod. It wasn't fairly easy to install. The roller hooks that come with it roll really nice. I have a shower curtain I also purchased and it is just simply beautiful. Really sets off the bath.\n",
      "I would not recommend this, unless it was free or unless you are looking for ear warmers. It doesn't cover my ear (and I have small ears) If you bend the wire at all, the signal to the left ear shorts out and makes a static sound. I suppose this would be alright if you stayed absolutely still while listening to them... and if you add some kind of padding.\n",
      "The rolling duffle was worth the investment. It withstood the hussle and bussle of being transported from aircraft to aircraft. It is spacious in the main cabin. The nine pockets around the bag makes it great for packing smaller things, or extra clothing.\n",

      "Got this for my daughter as one of her Christmas presents due to the fact every time me or my wife were on one of our iPads she would she (3 years old at the time, now 4) would want to play with it, since we downloaded a couple of apps for her. So I said to myself “get her something like an iPad but for kids\" so I wound up getting this.  IF we didn't have any iPads, I think she would have continued to love it, but we had iPads and soon found that it wasn't an “iPad\" so she still would take ours.<br />I ended up getting her an iPad Mini with an Otterbox Defender case. The Leapfrog itself is, in my opinion, not worth the price, I bought one for $170 at the time, the screen is really not that great, the resolution sucks, the games are just as expensive as Apple apps are, and though it can take a beating as she does still play with it ONCE in a while, spend the extra cash and get an iPad mini with a VERY good case, and child proof it with passwords, the leapfrog is very child friendly in terms of them not being able to access the internet, only a “special\" internet, that was the only real plus.\n",
      "This mattress is loud as my little one crawls around on it- she roams around the crib a lot as she sleeps. It's irritating for me if I'm in the room but not loud enough to seem to wake her. Got this to go in a mini crib at the grandparents when she visits. It's just &#34;OK&#34;.\n",
      "Online gameplay is not very good it takes hours to find an opponent but overall it's very good game but getting platinum is a nightmare . Whoever done this trophies for this  game is a psycho...\n",
      "What can I say? They didn't take much breaking in at all - no blisters. The back zipper is sturdy and no problem getting them on and off. We haven't had much of a mud season, but they seem to be holding up well to her stomping around in the yard. They look great, too.\n",
      "I'm not new to technology by any means but even I'm having trouble with this despite ample information resource. This could mean that I'm really bad at this or the product needs improvement in this area.\n",
      "keeps my toddler form bumping his head into table corners especially now that he's starting to walk. this worked fine except after a couple of months when the adhesives start to lose their sticking powers.\n",
      "This made quite the difference for me and allowed me to get some much better results. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "I'm so nervous about using this since it feels really flimsy. I know that it's for kids, but doesn't that make it worse? Kids break even the toughest bags all the time! I would be very nervous about recommending this to other people as well.\n",
      "This is particularly useful when working on floating objects like electrical outlets or car parts, or when working in tight spaces with it set to the straight grip position.\n",
      "An American tale can rival many of today's animations, if not put them to shame. Can't say the same for its sequels, but the first is a winner.\n",
      "It looks good in the photos, but the quality isn't there. The old adage, you get what you pay for applies here.\n",
      "I was ready to give up on this product until I ordered the matching BenchDog cones. I'm much happier with these when they're just used as a nonslip tool for finishing my projects.\n",
      "this is quite easy to assemble. however, the lacquer on the legs are slightly different from the top. but it's a table, per se.\n",
      "One of the four chairs arrived crushed. The shipping box was not damaged so it happened in transit. They offered to send a replacement however the quality is missing so back they go. The other chairs have dimples, ridges, not of good quality. In this case you get what you pay for.\n",
      "The sandbox style allows great variety in play. Rescuing your family is perhaps the most challenging aspect simply owing to time constraints and over time some of it can get a bit stale but I've found that picking it back up again after awhile seems to restore some oomf to it.\n",
      "The color does not match what I have received, so imagine my disappointment when the gloves arrived and the reverse was true; they were the color. I didn't open the plastic they were wrapped in since I knew I'd be returning them, so I can't judge the quality of material or construction.\n",
      "This is the best one I found in this price range. First, I can say that it's accurate at the depths I've gone which is up and down and only to about 20- 25 feet. I've watched it to see if it's tracking me correctly and the numbers look good. It's VERY readable and bright so underwater and it's manageable even with thin gloves on. I think it's a score for it's capabilities and it's price.\n",
      "I had to return this watch because it didn't give the correct time for my State. I bought this watch for a birthday present for my son. My son was so upset to find out that the watch he picked out over the internet didn't state the actually locations.\n",
      "My husband kept losing his wedding ring that looked very much like this one, but was titanium. After replacing it twice, I went in search of a cheaper option. This ring was perfect.\n",
      "Not quite what I was looking for.   This one may have been a bit better http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0076AU0YS   Now they have the &#34;make sure it works&#34; checker at the top.\n",
      "I did not get a manual with the TV and there were already some channels pre-set. These do not align with channels in my area. I'm also having issues just getting reception so all in all I cannot even use the TV yet. What picture I have seen on the set looks good.\n",
      "This floor runner is a stylish piece. It has added good décor to my living room. Its appearance is same as what is displayed;. The anti-skid option is correct- it has good grip.\n",
      "A little bigger than expected. Very sharp and decent price for what you get. A little disappointed with the paint over the knife and the knife sharpener. The angle on the sharpener is a little off and it scratches the paint.\n",
      "I will agree with the other reviewers about the floating problems . Aside from that, they are perfect for the bath, my daughter really really wanted a sail boat for the bath.\n",
      "Purchased this at chinese market for under 7 bucks so this is a rip, although they may have to compensate for shipping.<br />It is not much of a green tea powder taste however, mostly milky tea.\n",
      "I'm a Pilates instructor so I figured this might be a good video to get so that I may tell some of my baby boomer clients to buy it.  It is very suitable for the boomer population that need basic exercises.  The pictures and descriptions of the muscles being worked was kind of neat.  I would not purchase this DVD if you are already super in shape and can do reformer Pilates.  Otherwise it's worth the $12.99.\n",
      "My new area rugs would not stay in place. But after I purchased the rug pads made especially for carpet, they are secure, not trying to roll up or slide with me.\n",
      "I used this oven four times in the week I had it. One morning I was using it to cook breakfast when the glass door exploded into bits all over the counter. I contacted Hamilton Beach but they don't seem very concerned about it nor have a solution other than a replacement after I send in the defective model and wait three weeks.\n",
      "The price of the router should have been a giveaway but I was hoping to upgrade from the cheap router I had originally. I saw the good reviews and hoped I would get an increase in performance from my internet.<br /><br />What I actually got was a smaller signal and lower speeds that I originally had before. I'm not an expert but I don't see how that is possible based on what the people said giving this 5 stars.<br /><br />I dealt with this router for a while before finally I had enough and did some research. I ended up finding a router that was a BIG difference in quality and performance.<br /><br />I get full connection anywhere in my three story house as well as even outside. I love it!<br /><br />I got it here on Amazon ----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nixMuc<br /><br />It is probably one of the best investments I've ever made! If it's not for you, at least I could share my experience!\n",
      "Very poorly made, stitching all over the place and already coming apart.<br />Worst of all is the smell. It stinks of a dead animal for 3 weeks\n",
      "We are very disappointed with this product. Lithium chemical battery leaked and causes a nasty burn on my dog's neck.\n",
      "Don't buy these speakers if you want decent sound quality. These speakers sound like my clock radio. Very cheaply made.\n",
      "This product was well worth the money! If you are just starting out I recommend this guitar. For beginners make sure to change string after a lot of use. It is a good guitar!\n",
      "They don't look bad but definitely different than expected. I would prefer them to be uniformly dark, but for what I paid it doesnt really matter to me.\n",
      "This bag is modern looking with many pockets and pouches to store everything my little one will need. It comes with a bag for dirty/wet laundry and a changing pad. The only thing I wasn't 100% happy about was that the colour I wanted wasn't available. Everything else is fabulous!\n",
      "this is the best dvd for the kids. they really loved it this movie kept their eyes glued to the screen it really made a big difference to them happy they watched it.\n",
      "I have a new puppy. This dog bed is quite okay..<br />I have the black and white color but I really want a color black because it's easier to clean.<br />My puppy always sleeps on it, that's all.\n",
      "The only reason I can't rate it a 5 star is because I have not crash tested it. This is my first helmet and it is very confortable and styling. It adjusts well to fit your size and head shape\n",
      "I am utterly disappointed in this monitor, as it blurs everything. Reading small print is horrible. No idea how people cope with this! Don't buy this if you want to use it for any reading or writing on your computer, or any art making!\n",
      "I thought the duel core would make be faster in processing, but I was wrong. I'm still having the same problem with this computer as with my recent replaced computer. Also I thought the computer comes with an already loaded startup ware, but was disappointed to find out that this start ware is only temporarily.\n",
      "I tried to give this one a chance even when none of my friends liked it and even when my husband couldn't stand a single sip. However, it just was not meant to be since it's just not our cup of – whatever this is...\n",
      "These are wonderful and a great price and I will be buying more soon. Highly recommend these! Also they are holding up very well.\n",
      "It takes about 200 pumps to get a completely flat 26\" x 2.1 tube to 45 pounds. It locks on to presta valves very easily and stays connected while pumping. It's not the best pump if you are in a hurry, but perfect for an emergency along the trail.\n",
      "The all mighty dollar wins again, as they stretched them out to make more money with all kinds of filler. Good but could have been so much better.\n",
      "it's nice and handy with quick heat, a bucket full of water gets bathing temperature within 5 minutes. very handy when time is short for heat.\n",
      "As a piece of fun \"costume\" jewelry, this can't be beat. It certainly gets attention, but is a little cumbersome on the wrist. I certainly wouldn't recommend it for daily wear. And for all its massive size, it is still difficult to read the time as the hands are the same color as the face.\n",
      "I bought the plates as additions for when we had a lot of company over for dinner. They chip very easily on the corners. I do not wash them in he dishwasher I simply wash by hand and almost all of them have chips on the corners. I do not recommend buying these.\n",
      "We loved the photo, but when we got it out of the box, the pieces came with lables which you were supposed to figure out which pieces were which and put the labels on (kind of pointless?). Then when we went to put it together, the pieces didn't fit properly and one of the pegs went all the way through from the inside to the finished side. It was a mess!\n",
      "I'll be honest this isn't the best creation of Ralphie May but it made me laugh several times. The concept is unique and it needs to be polished a little bit.\n",
      "I have to say, I'm fairly disappointed in this book. First, it reads like an essay written by a high school student; the author is clearly not a writer, and I'm surprised it made it to publication in this format. Secondly, it spends a significant portion of time singing the praises of  The Caring Pregnancy Center, in Minnesota. That place has been caught on film telling scared, pregnant young women that abortion can lead to breast cancer. It's shameful to promote an organization that lies to girls to promote its anti-woman agenda. While the information on deaf history and culture in the U.S. is interesting, I would not recommend this book to others.\n",
      "Love the picture. I didn't pay attention to the size when I ordered it so I really wish it was a bigger picture. I'll keep it though because I still love the sayings!\n",
      "Perfect for backpacking or camping in any weather, I also use this in our living room when I watch T.V. and the temperature gets low.  The material is great and it feels really comfortable.\n",
      "This is cool but not actually cold.  It has held together well too.  I play a lot of sports in the summer and it can get pretty hot.  This is a refreshing way to cool off.  I just dip it in my cooler that has ice in it and put it around my neck.<br /><br />It also helps with minor aches and pains.  I sprained my ankle a few weeks ago and this helped keep the swelling down until I could get home and treat it with my warrior mist pain spray [[ASIN:B00A347MD6 Warrior Mist Pain Reliever + FREE Vivazen Pain Killer Shot]].<br /><br />Our whole softball team has bought these and everybody we play against always wants to use them and know where we got them from.  I think our team has single handedly \"sold\" over a hundred of these.  Everybody in our league is getting them.\n",
      "This is good for the dogs to chew on and helps to keep their teeth clean in between brushings. There prices you can't whip and the delivery is wonderful. My dog loves these and I make sure he has one everyday.\n",
      "I purchased this keyboard a few months ago and was looking forward to a decent keyboard for for a good price.<br /><br />This keyboard feels awkward when you type and the keys are very weird and almost impossible to get used to.<br /><br />I played a few games on it to see how it performed and to hopefully become accustomed to the keyboard, but I just couldn't. The keys wouldn't read my inputs sometimes and everything just felt clunky and cheap.<br /><br />Overall, my experience with this keyboard was horrible, which is why I took the time to find a QUALITY keyboard that will last and be friendly to use. Luckily, after searching for weeks, I finally settled on a keyboard I love! I have used it for just over a month now and the difference in picture quality and overall function is amazing. I am using it right now to type this!<br /><br />If you'd like to take a look at this keyboard GO HERE -------&#62; http://amzn.to/1tONQ9p<br /><br />It is here on Amazon and you won't be disappointed, I promise! If it's not the keyboard for you, I'm glad I could at least share my experience!\n",
      "This isn't Apple certified. After about two days, I began to receive a message on my phone stating that it was not compatible. Although it the cord states a 2 yr warranty, I noticed that there is a very short return window on Amazon. The warranty is a nice courtesy; however, I feel that having to go through all that customer service trouble to only risk having the product work for another few weeks was not worth the trouble. It's a shame because I really wanted an extra long cable.\n",
      "GREAT PICTURE, NOT FOGGY OR HAZY, THE CHANELS CHANGE VERY FAST, EASY INSTALL, AND THE PICTURE IS AWESOME!\n",
      "I loved the look of this stroller and since my cat is very sick I wanted to be able to get her some fresh air. This fits the bill. However, it is somewhat cheaply made and the wheels seem to be wearing out quickly.\n",
      "I have bought every call of duty game since the first modern warfare.  Modern Warfare 3 put a bad taste in my mouth, this one did not bring any improvements in my mind.  Hopefully the franchise improves.\n",
      "I didn't want a chair with wheels, so I got this one. I wasn't thinking about the fact that it has arms and would be difficult to get in and out of. The arms are not removable, and they are so low that you wouldn't really use them anyway.\n",
      "I ordered this mat as I have been using a mat of the same brand for some time and its great. Unfortunately, this mat is not good. It is slippery. It also leaves your foot/hand impression on the it. I would not recommend this for yoga.\n",
      "It has only been up not very long. Now that it is up, it shows as cheap - not a great quality. It is ok. Great price. I bought it because of the design. The silver shade doesn't rest smooth on the bulb. You have to giggle it to get it lay and it still doesn't play well. If the pendant gets bumped the shade will slide and it isn't even.\n",
      "The coffeemaker grounds coffee in very coarse grinds, so we ended up using much more whole beans to get the same strength as another model that we replaced. So now we have to use pre-grounded coffee on this machine, but it defeated the purpose of having a built-in grinder. I wished I can return it.\n",
      "I was able to reduce my scoliosis because I followed the exercises on this DVD... definitely worth a try for any one with scoliosis. I know how it feels to feel hopeless because of your condition.\n",
      "I am so glad I finally got an ac adapter to be able to charge my GPS in my home instead of having to travel with wires in my face. Now I can charge my GPS anytime of the day or night. Would recommend this adapter to anyone who likes conveniences.\n",
      "it doesn't feel nice to grip this one. it's uncomfortable. and i have to keep on holding the button to keep it working. it's a hassle, really.\n",
      "I was very excited to find these gloves because I have been looking for a nice pair of colored leather gloves for some time. I ordered the blue because I thought that they would go nicely with my black coat.\n",
      "I just want to get across to you that this product in no way shape or form an air conditioner or even a fan for that matter. I would describe it as an air mover. There are so many problems with the air cooler that I can't even figure out where to start..\n",
      "And pictures on the same whistle, and I find the same. My goal, I cut the rope, and replaced with a small key ring.<br /><br />How does it sound? If you have a good, fast-paced, loud, rough, sharp, harsh, you can give a good attention for safety reasons, or will soon notice some football player. Be sure not to play at home, it is very easy to make your ears hurt.\n",
      "It seems to be ok and dependable.  YOu can tell the time easily.  I haven't tested it under water,but it says it's water resistant.\n",
      "The seat itself is very well made and I love the overall look. The parts that I don't care for are the clip that you buckle everything into my son sits on it and it's not easy to pull out. The straps twist and I have to undo and it's unsafe if you just leave them.\n",

      "I hate the way this band fastens. It wants to slide off every time I get a little bit sweaty, which if you are wearing the thing you are probably going to have some sweat.\n",
      "I was mesmerized with these LED lights. I put it in our master's bedroom just to try if it will work just fine. It works at its best. The light was shining brightly without so much heat compared to other bulbs that I used before. This is way better than those lights. I would definitely buy another one for our living room and children's room. My children and wife really liked these lights.\n",
      "My biggest complaint is the volume control, it is hard to get it set correctly, and it is easily bumped to a new setting. Some sort of lock would be useful as would reference numbers so you could see the setting. Better yet would two push buttons, one for louder and one for quieter.\n",
      "I love these chairs and the look of industrial metal furniture. These were a fraction of the cost of the more popular chairs, a French cafe style chair that I've been wanting to purchase. I love them and they suit our space beautifully. I was also interested in the painted red ones!\n",
      "I bought one of these off TV way back when.  It was on an infomercial and Tony Little was the spokesperson.  He had a ponytail and wore short shorts.  Anyway, this thing gave me a massive backache.  Put me down for a couple of days.  Never went back to the thing.\n",

      "Good price, Pan/Tilt, Watch camera video from my cell phone, Camera emails images when motion is detected. Camera works well, setup for these cameras takes many steps but this has good quick start vedio instructions that simplify the process. This camera has given me peace of mind when I am away. I can check on my home and pets at anytime from my smartphone or computer when I am away. I also like the fact that I can turn the sound on hear what is going on my home. But Not very clear for communicating with its build in mic.I added a external speaker and mic so that i can use the two way audio. So far it works very wel\n",
      "I ordered this because I had the standard issue, over the shoulder laptop bag which was bulky, heavy and horrible. This bag looks better and the handles are very well attached so that I have no thought of them pulling away -- which is an important feature to me. Drawback is that there is very little room inside for other things.\n",
      "This product is not as deep as I expected for storage, a nice blanket has a hard time fitting in it. One of the legs hole for inserting the pre-drilled hole was out of alignment and took a while to get it to insert and finish putting it together. I was not impressed and if my dog didn't like it, I would have returned it.\n",
      "These were a terrible set of lights. They didn't even work at all. I can't believe I spent $50.00 on a set of lights that didn't have any bulbs with it.  I was very disappointed that I spent the money on these lights.\n",
      "Major waste of money. They were significantly smaller than a US Size 8, which is what I ordered. I'm very suspicious of the other reviews because the shoes is so bad. It's terribly stiff, extremely flat, and significantly not as described. Very Upset. To make matters worse, seller wants ME to pay to ship them back.\n",
      "I haven't actually used this swing yet, but just a warning... I ordered my swing online and put it together. Not thinking about it, I threw my box away (which had my receipt on it) without trying out the swing. A few days later I purchased batteries and low and behold my music player was broken. So now I have a swing that swings, but does not play music! Don't forget to try it out before throwing the box away!\n",

      "My 7 year old twins have a ball with this thing nearly everyday! We live in a pretty safe cul-de-sac so they're forever taking turns zipping up and down the road with it. Right out of the box it seemed sturdy and well-suited for us. My kids are average weight for their age so there's not much problem with lagging or anything. We also make sure to keep it charged up and the tires seem like they'll last quite a while although I'm already prepared to buy new ones if need be. If only it ran a little longer each use, it would be perfect!\n",

      "Bought two of these last month. They're thinner than the two I bought two summers ago. These two don't cut the heat or sun exposure much. You'll still need sunscreen and sunglasses when sitting under them. Also, I wish the description had mentioned that the poles are black; they look tacky with the beige stands I'd bought for the previous two (which had beige poles).<br />If you're looking for umbrellas that give true sun and heat protection, these aren't it. I do like the very bright, saturated yellow color. These won't fade as quickly as the previous two, most likely.\n",
      "This is a cheap pair of gloves and that's because it was made to be cheap to begin with. I knew that when I bought it so the disappointment really isn't that strong.\n",
      "This antenna booster really not work at all, even I tried in my house or my daughter's house, just not work and receive fewer channel also the quality is bad, I am not sure I got lemon but I am so disappointed.  *** We do follow the instruction and we are not close to the tower and still not work!\n",
      "I thought this would be an amusing little fare with my husband but he ended up amused by the gadget and now he wears it every day. He even showed it to his friends who want one for themselves.\n",
      "It is a comfortable case, enough space for the camera, besides it has pockets that enable you store many useful things.\n",
      "My baby wore this for her photo shoot on her 1st birthday. She looks appealing and extremely gorgeous on it! It's weird that she didn't have tantrums during the photo shoot. I think she's comfortable with the lion costume!\n",
      "BEST POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA I HAVE PURCHASED. HAS MANY FLEXIBLE FUNCTIONAL SETTINGS AND FAST EXPOSURE SPEED (ENOUGH TO STOP THOSE BLURRED GRAND KIDS SHOTS). TAKES GOOD LOW LIGHT AND OUTDOOR NIGHT PICTURES. THE FLASH WORKINGS ARE VERY DELICATE LOOKING. IF THE CAMERA WAS UNDER WATER RATED, HAD A HOT SHOE, HIGH SHOCK RESISTANCE, AND A EYE VIEWER I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS.\n",
      "I like how wide this belt is because the narrow ones are so uncomfortable to wear all day. This I can wear without it biting into me.\n",
      "When my daughter saw this backpack, she can't wait to move her stuff to the new one. It's so cute and colorful especially the little &#34;Map&#34;. Thanks for the happiness you bring to my sunshine.\n",
      "I thought this would look good on my boyfriend when I saw it and it turns out that I was right. He  was all fussy at first, saying how I didn't need to get him anything, but he ended up wearing the thing all the time anyway.\n",
      "This is made of plastic, and depending on how it is shipped it can be bent when you receive it, after a few minutes the strap inside came of so I had to hold it from the side. but it looks just like the picture and it's pretty cool.\n",
      "it should actually fit. I can barely get the hood to screw onto anything 58mm, and when it does, the threads inside were so cheaply made that I've had the hood fall off numerous time just from my 75-300mm's autofocus spinning.\n",
      "The rug itself does look very nice in our apartment and we really love the pattern of it, we just wish the color had been true to that we picked and anticipated rather than we got and that the texture of the rug was softer and didn't pull/shed as easily as it does, making it look and feel much cheaper than it was.\n",
      "The unit came quickly, was easy to put together, and looked great. However the more I used it I was not super happy with it. The drawers when filled are hard to slide in the tracks and can pop out. Not a good system to hold a lot of weight in the sliders.\n",
      "I bought this product reading all these good reviews thinking I was getting a masterpiece of equipment!!! HOW I WAS WRONG!!!! It doesn't if extend as wide as it says and if you try to extend it wide, the two outer pieces fall off!!!!!!\n",
      "I couldn't wait to open it. It was well packaged and shipped. I opened and read the booklet with it and then plugged it in. I had to reconfigure some settings in Cakewalk with audio output and once I did that this thing was a beautiful piece of work.\n",
      "This is a great little basic sweatshirt. It washes up well. My only recommendation is that if you like roominess, order one size larger, as it is a bit form fitting. Will order more : )\n",
      "These are fine pieces and are really well made too. I wouldn't say that they are the best since I found some that are better. These are still good though.\n",
      "I found it pretty entertaining and different from other chick flicks. Marital problems avoided and a perfect family in the end? Only in movies... Overall a nice way to spend evening with a glass of wine and discuss it later with real friends with kids\n",
      "took like a month to arrive and then when I use it, it disconnects as a bluetooth device like every minute or so.  I flip the power off then back on and it reconnects.  great concept and design but not really useable for me.\n",
      "I wasn't impressed with this set. One of the mugs had a small chip on the rim but since they are a gift I do not have time to return them. They are also lighter in weight than I expected. Even without the chip I wouldn't purchase these again.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this bag. Thought it would be perfect to take my files as well as my laptop around when I had to go to appointment. However, the handles started to rip after 3 or 4 days of use. The only thing that I had in the bag was my laptop and one case file.\n",
      "I can say that this camera isn't the best when it comes to durability because after 3.5 years of service, my 7D just stopped working. I don't know why, I treated it like a baby since it's my first DSLR. Now I don't know what to do, it's already out of warranty and might be costly if I send it to Canon for repair. I had 60K actuation and it never fail me before, but know this happened and don't know what to do. I tried all known methods/tricks to give back it's power but nothing worked.<br /><br />This camera can give you the level of pixels you expect for 18MP and the fast performance when it comes to focusing. However, you should know that you also need a good lens to get sharp images, trust me. Use prime lenses. they're tact sharp. zoom lenses have sweet spots but when you use prime lens you'll get what you want!<br /><br />If you really want a DSLR that will last I think you should change your mind and get an inexpensive model instead and just invest in lenses. DSLRs have a life span and you'll regret if you spend a lot of money on a full frame or a semi pro DSLRs and after 3+ years it will be dead and unusable. I've been there, trust me.\n",
      "Oh, the shape, the feel, the smoothness, they are all so good! But who really cares, right? It's a toilet paper holder and it does the job rather well. I don't really have anything to complain about when it comes to this item. It does the job.\n",
      "You should have a Motion Controller if want to play Move games on the PS3. You may need more if you are interested in playing multi-player games. So all I can say is buy this one if you want to move you body! The piece that I received was original and gave excellent response!\n",
      "Very good looking leather. I'm into it I think that the leather is what makes the bracelet worth wearing. Rope is strong and won't rip after a few weeks of wearing it. This should last you a while.\n",
      "I was looking forward to a perfectly seasoned grilling experience, but my Sunday was nearly ruined instead. I had to make another batch of sauce from scratch because the mixture from the container spilled after I tried to open it when it wouldn't work. Really disappointing.\n",
      "Strengths: Lightweight and Comfortable.<br />Weaknesses: The Audio output gives a popping sound and falls when I get to move and run.\n",
      "What can I say. It is a good paddle for the price that I paid. The contour of the paddles look great. The shaft is a little smaller than others, but does not seem to hurt the performance of it. I also purchased the carlisle day tripper paddle from amazon as well. I must say that I favor it abit more than this shoreline paddle, but overall the shoreline is worth the price. If I had a choice, I would buy another one for a backup.\n",
      "i bought this item and not only was it gorgeous. but it arrived earlier than expected! everything was spelt correctly and looked just as gorgeous as it did in the pick if not BETTER! its something i would recommend for everyone. its simple.\n",
      "The product looks attractive..but not all what it looks in the pics and i reality is..much different...the aviator is small in size, tint not all good, no sun light proving, uncomfortable, small in size..the other is at least ok...buy if u are not left with any other option...\n",
      "These are a decent little pair of binoculars. The light gathering power is not enormous, but I was able to see night sky objects well, andromeda galaxy and the Pleiades star cluster looked nice. They fold up and are fairly compact. Good for daylight viewing and bird watching, not the best out there, but good for being very inexpensive.\n",
      "Very beautiful, focal point of any room. Looks great above our kitchen island table. Our fixture seems to hang a bit crooked (barely noticeable and may be our old house). Many options for length extension. Good illumination down and up to ceiling.\n",
      "The quality of this robe is really nice, however, if you are planning to order it go a size smaller. I bought it for my husband, who normally wears a medium, and he swam in it. Too bad about the return/exchange policy, I don't like that I will be charged a shipping fee to exchange it.\n",
      "I have a iPad Air. It does noteven fit it. I like the whole concept. But why does it say iPad Air and it does not fit?\n",
      "Got these for my husband and he is in love with them! Wears them all day long. He is going to wear them out quickly! I barely see him with shoes on now.\n",
      "Yes it does looks lovely in photo right? But how does it actually look when you bought it? Let me point out a few things why some of us here are disappointed about this product.<br />- The color of the pillow stains with each other so it really gives this BEAUTIFUL daybed a huge mess<br />- The cushion covers are sewn backwards. Yes, backyards, so as a result, it doesn't look good.<br />- Colors easily fade! It doesn't look good after a few weeks of use or a month or more, so it is really disappointing.<br />- It's not easy to clean unlike the other daybeds out there. The cushions are really hard to remove and as I've said, colors fade and stain other cloth.<br />Overall, it's really annoying. Not worth the money.\n",
      "Awesome game to play. Magnificent graphics and sounds! The sounds of the blazing guns will make you wanna make you pull the trigger every second. There are also a lot of changes from the original game which makes it more enjoyable.<br /><br />Give this game a whirl and you will not be disappointed. I assure you of that.\n",
      "The only reason i bought this was to make sure nobody else would.  It will be immediately destroyed.  Its is not safe.\n",
      "Got this as a wedding gift last week. Seemed cheapy but we were looking forward to using it more than many other things we got. Total bust. Broke on us on the 2nd vegetable. Threw it in the garbage. Needs to be made much better. People, please buy quality gifts or just give cash\n",
      "I have a pit bull and the collar won't stay around my dog's neck. The fastner doesn't work. I've heard others have the same issue.\n",
      "I think the watch is really pretty and looks so beautiful and gold. Um, only thing that disappointed me about this watch is it did not come in a box! :( lol It was wrapped in bubble wrap. I wanted it to come in a box because I was buying it as a gift for my aunt and everyone knows I can't give her a watch without a box! It will look used. :) Anyways.. I talked with the sellers about that concern I had and they were very understanding and dealt with me very patiently, prompt and professional. So, \"Lovers2009\" are indeed excellent sellers to deal with when you have concerns.<br /><br />This all being said, the watch does NOT look cheap in anyway and is so worth the 6 bucks, it is such a steal for the look. I received it ticking and in great condition. Oh and one last thing worth mentioning if I were to use it, it did not fit on my wrist. Keep in mind your wrist size, I would say this is for women with big wrists. Sorry girls, unless you want to scoot the watch up like on your arm to let it fit. I hope my review is helpful. Thanks! If you want to see a personal photo I took of the watch please e-mail me at Hebakadadah33@gmail.com. It won't let me post pictures on this review! Thanks!\n",
      "if you are selling replacement suction cups, it is pretty clear you are selling them because they didn't work in the first place which is lame. I did not want to have to buy this, so I am a little bitter about that\n",
      "i ordered 2 of these for my boys. they are a ok mattress . it is what i thought it would be  for the price i paid . well work for a while for them .\n",
      "There was considerable distortion, mostly on the right channel when running this amp in Bluetooth mode. It was working better when hard wired to the source.\n",
      "This is the coolest wallet I've ever owned in my entire life. It's comfortably thin, has pockets for cards, and water proof. I kept my first one in my back pocket for over a year  before it started unraveling on me. I tried taping it back together, but that didn't work out too well. Well, at least now I can get another design without having to feel too guilty about it. If you're looking for a wallet that'll last you a lifetime, this is not it. But if you're looking for something that'll make people ooh and ahh while it lasts, then get this awesome wallet.\n",
      "The house we live in more dirt and dust than house, which is why my wife decided to get this vacuum because it was powerful. It worked for quite a while actually and it was great, but then it just stopped working one day and never turned on again. We had it cleaned and fixed, but there was nothing. Such a shame.\n",
      "This has made absolutely no difference to the performance of my mobile operation. The signal strength has not increased at all. Complete waste of money. Sorry but it has to be said.\n",
      "While I love the bracelet, I was very disappointed that it \"looked\" really dirty when I received it. I had to clean it with a silver jewelry cloth to shine it up before I could wear it. Once it was polished, it looked so much better.\n",
      "The ones I received were not all different colors as pictured. Luckiy, I am a girl and don't mind all the purple and pink!\n",
      "Great products, great quality great fees and delivery are always before than the expected date. Compare to what is out there in retail store this was a great buy, this is my first blue-ray and I love it.\n",
      "I bought these after reading the positive reviews previous customers left. I am very pleased with the quality of the product, ease of installation, and price. We purchased a new home and every window has these blinds in them. I gave this a 3 because the crown valance won't work in my windows, so I wish there was an option to have the valance cut straight. Other than that, great!!\n",
      "I've owned a few cheap compressors that I got from Walmart and this one is much better and a lot more quiet. Great little compressor for the money. Solidly built, quiet and fills tires pretty quickly. Recommended product here\n",
      "I ordered this from Joss and Main and received it yesterday. I am a little disappointed because the color is not as seen as the picture appears. It's closer to a light tan in my opinion...<br /><br />Also the fabric looks almost like a velvet blend, which I wasn't too happy about either.\n",
      "nice tank. just the right size and shape for my room. but the lid lights burn out fast. and the filter sits oddly.\n",
      "I thought I would never find a pair of fashion glasses that would actually look right on my face and these do, just awesome. I get compliments on these glasses every time I wear them. My friends are planning to have one.\n",
      "This handy light really works! I use it to de text were my male kitty has sprayed. Sadly it was in more placeses than I expect. Also is great to detect any spot of water or oil.\n",
      "The mat said that it's \"self-healing”, I don't get how it is, but it lasting just as long as all of the other mats I have had. I do like that it comes in two different sizes though, a 14x14 and an 8x8.\n",
      "Had a bad experience with this product and their customer service center is terrible.<br />Connected this to my MacBook and this lagged all the time.\n",
      "I hate to be negative but what is all the hype about? Maybe its just no my thing. I tried, but just didn't find it interested at all.\n",
      "Had a spot that I could smell but couldn't get rid of so I purchased this unit thinking it would do the trick. It dint work at all, total scam.\n",
      "I got these for my daughter's desk. They add just the right touch of pretty sparkle. They have a nice, heavy, quality feeling to them. They arrived in perfect condition, no chips on the glass or anything like that. The only minor complaint I would have is that the screw was very long.\n",
      "We have had to replace 3 in 1 year .It is a hassle to have to mail them back and sometime they gave me so much attitude in the customer service division...I went with Belkin and I have had no more replacement problems because it works right and doesn't go out every 3 months.\n",
      "admittedly, it's a bit small for the stuff i usually bring with me. it's regrettably a wrong choice for me. if only i wasn't attracted to it's cool design, i wouldn't have bought this one.\n",
      "Ended up buying one of these because it was the only one available at the store and I needed one in a hurry for a shoot the next day.  You get what you pay for, basically.  It's lightweight, but feels cheap...head movement is minimal and any attempt to swivel will result in some severe choppiness.  I felt like I was going to break it most of the time while using it, which isn't the best feeling when you're working with expensive equipment on top.\n",
      "The shipping was fast. I like this one, they are great for evening rides. The color of the led is not pink but all in all it's a great purchase.\n",
      "Not good. Get a pair of these instead. http://www.amzn.gift/B004WZVO68/  Just for the record, I'm not your typical jaded 'beats hater', largely (well probably solely) because I didn't plunk down my own hard-earned cash on these expecting to be blown away. I simply had a bunch of Macy's store credit and gift cards with no better place to go than on some new cans. I figured they would be disappointing but passable and that's exactly what they are.  I hope this review was helpful!\n",
      "Ok, this handbag is a very nice one. After checking it out, I decided it was too big for what I need so am giving it to my granddaughter as she needs that size for what she carries. Thank you!\n",
      "It did nothing. Like, at all. The clothes didn't dry any faster and I couldn't see any discernable difference. They break easy too. These are definitely not worth the money.\n",
      "I had better expectation but I was so disappointed when I received my copy. This is not a stand alone book and you must heavily rely on PMBOK which is the most boring and ridiculous book I have even seen. This one is certainly as boring and dry as the PMBOK.  Questions are not too bad.\n",
      "They are dog treats what can you say. The price was right. I don't eat them. I still need four words to finish.\n",
      "Bought the case, was a bit nervous about the low price.. Don't want to buy a new one next trip..case worked as carry on, wheels roll smoothly, and the aesthetic is nice.. Stands out. i will be ordering the larger size. Stop debating.. buy it. it is probably the one..\n",
      "It holds things in place. I have little figurines that constantly fall over and lose their heads when the cats decide to jump on or off the bookcase. It keeps delicate things standing upright. It works well on candles and top heavy vases. It's tacky without being a mess. You can pop it off any surface. I haven't noticed any staining on my wooden shelves. A good product.\n",
      "I bought this for my niece and she thanked me for it. Physically, I think it's very sturdy and well-made. As for the use, I'm not really sure but the covers my niece has been recording has improved, I must say!\n",
      "My daughter always gets pretty cool, nice gifts from her friends at birthday parties and we’re always trying to put together even better gift bags for her guests than before. We’ve found all types of cool little things to add here on Amazon and we ordered a whole lot of these bracelets for her last birthday party. We order two colors of this style so that the kids could layer them if they wanted. They seemed to be a huge hit and although they’re cheap, it doesn’t seem like anyone had an issue making it last!\n",
      "Kept me a float that's really all that mattered.<br />The foam is not very conforming but I expected that so it met my expectations. It adjusts well and as previously stated it kept me afloat. Can't ask for more than that\n",
      "It was ok..... not a great story line. However I would say its worth watching because of the special effects. Very cool to watch in 3D.\n",
      "It's a beautiful necklace I have received many compliments on it.  I have the matching earrings as well.\n",
      "this particular Power Cord and he found this for us on Amazon. The price, (according to him) was very good, so we purchasaed it and it arrived in record time.\n",
      "This bag seemed as if it would meet all of my needs and personal taste, perfectly. Unfortunately, upon receipt, my heart dropped as soon as I opened the box. The thing that jumped right out at me, right away, was that the exterior pocket, w/the flap was defective.\n",
      "Because of the base moldings on my wall, the gate would not fit. With the extension it was too wide, without the extension pieces the adjusters were too extended and would buckle out on pressure!!!!! So frustrating. PS the opening I am trying to fit them.\n",
      "this is a breeze to set up if you have experience with tents or camping gear. for a beginner or novice i would not recommend it. in case you trying to decide you should give it a shot it's a good deal.\n",
      "I have two kids and as you can imagine a lot of cereal and other goodies get all over the inside of the car.  I just got this and have to say my favorite part is the length of the cord.  I can reach the corners of the back seat..yippee.  It works well and easily so that's a super plus for this mom!\n",
      "this is durable, but if you have a nice deck area you might not like the way it looks. it is basic beige plastic with a dark top. it looks very utilitarian. so if you have a colonial or cape cod house you might not really appreciate the lack of design.\n",
      "You cannot bridge an Ethernet connection using this product. You must use an Ethernet Switch to bridge an Ethernet cable. However this product description says \"you cannot use both computers at the same time\", but this will only confuse your internet provider since each computer has a different hardware address in it.\n",
      "My cat loves playing with this so much that she even bugs me sometimes to play with her. I always have a great time whenever we run around and she chases me though so I don't mind. I just wish this would last a little longer.\n",
      "I checked to see if it appeared on animal food recall lists during the 2007 rice gluten (melamine) scare - it was never recalled. The label guarantees no wheat, soy or corn. He transitioned amazingly well and is behaving very puppy-like.\n",
      "I bought this backpack to take on my flight because it has so many compartments to store stuff in. Those were great and helped me to keep my stuff organized. The quality of the backpack could have been better. I don't know how long it will last. Held up for this trip fine though.\n",
      "These were my daughter’s idea and boy was the expression on her face when the balls just deflated fierce. Needless to say, I will be doing my shopping from now on.\n",
      "I previously purchased this outfit, and the manufacturing of the rod was poor. I returned it, and the company that distributes the rod and reel were very gracious. They convinced me that this was a rarity - that they've sold many of these without complaint.\n",
      "I purchased this DVD player to replace another that had been dropped several times. I just needed something to play DVDs on using my old TV set. Seemed perfect, inexpensive, small. The third DVD I played on this player is jammed in the player. It's turning out to be not so inexpensive. Add the price of a DVD to my subscription and it's a bit too expensive for me.\n",
      "This stuff was cheap. I am cheap so I bought it. Man do I regret it because my inner thieghs broke out like a mofo. My boyfriend thought I had the clap. Yiiiick!\n",
      "Love the product, just can't get the size right, no matter what size or review I try/read! Theyhave been wonderful regarding me returning the oversized rings though!\n",
      "Its a very nice travel bag i have ever seen,we can easily take this for one day journey quality product with nice space inside the bag\n",
      "I did not like this product at all. Item was not as it describes. Overall cheap quality and didnt work perfectly\n",
      "I am somewhat pleased with these speakers. However there is one issue. Both speaker grills showed some rust.\n",
      "Won't connect wirelessly. Now after eight months out of warranty, the volume controls refuse to work. It is stuck on the loudest setting. This is a decent product, however there are multiple issues with the factory firmware\n",
      "I was never in to this stuff, a friend of mine made me crazy to watch through the whole thing and that once I &#34;taste&#34; it I won't be bale to not watch, all these hours later....what a waste of time!!!\n",
      "I can take pictures with it as it is linked to my phone and then share the pictures using my phone internet when WiFi is not available. This is why I bought the camera in the first place because my cell phone camera bit the dust. I also like the fact that you can share pictures to Facebook or other social networks straight from the phone or email them.\n",
      "This is my dog's favorite toy and it takes a long time for her to chew it apart. He's a German Shepherd that destroys frisbees on one retrieve. It is also easy for them to catch it in the air because it is flexible.\n",
      "I purchased this as a gift for my brother who loves to grill. The utensils are high quality and worth the price. He hasn't really used the corn picks, but everything fits nicely in the case, so they don't get lost. The pieces are heavy enough to really last.\n",
      "I love this camera! It takes great close ups of flowers that are crisp and clear. There are so many different photo shooting options. I would recommend this camera.\n",
      "Dont look any further if your budget is low. Display quality will blow you away, even the sound quality is excellent.\n",
      "Sir, this DVD is not a Hollywood Production I understand and appreciate your feedback. However, I believe the content itself to be extremely valuable for the beginner. I assure you the video was not transferred from a VHS. The audio is fine, it was recorded inside my Greenhouse and I could not eliminate some of the background noise due to Greenhouse equipment operating but had never had anyone indicate the audio was unsatisfactory.\n",
      "First time using this piece and the zipper on one of the compartments is broken. The duffle is on its way to Japan' otherwise I would certainly be returning it. Certainly would not purchase anything by this manufacturer again\n",
      "I gave this as a gift. Upon trying it on- my brother-in-law did seem to need a bit more room in this carrier- he's a big guy, but not bigger than at all of Dads-to-be. So I was disappointed that it will only fit him over a t-shirt. He will have to have the baby under his jacket if it's cool or windy outside.\n",
      "I bought this unit for my family because:<br />- it was very attractive and low profile so it could sit in on our kitchen area desk and be very unobtrusive<br />- I wanted good quality photo prints on the occasions that I did those things<br />- I wanted good quality scans<br /><br />On all accounts above it looked and worked great.<br /><br />I also used it wirelessly on a reserved ip address (where it would always boot to that address), and again it was mostly flawless on that account.<br /><br />Now for THE BIG DOWNSIDES:<br />- ink is super expensive for daily printing of our kid's reports, etc and the cartridges are insultingly small in small capacity and large in cost<br />- constantly annoyed at always having to go back to the \"advanced\" dialog menu to change printing from color (expensive) to black and white (can't seem to make black and white default stick - I wonder why!)<br />- can only use Epson $$$ cartridges (electronically keyed or something as opposed to my old brother mfc-j630w that you can fill with generic ink once you buy the  refillable cartridges)<br />- I still ended up with problems only using the expensive Epson ink ordered directly from them (problems not initially, but later) when my perfectly fine original manufacturer cartridges stopped working (print gaps) even though they were almost new, and then in head cleaning or alignment to try and get a cartridge working again it would often tell me it no longer recognized some of the other cartridges that had previously be reported as near full, and that were previously printing fine, but now suddenly the printer had a problem with them?!<br /><br />In the end I wasted far too much of my time (and anguish) trying to get this thing to print again.<br /><br />My advice : stay away from this model (and probably this brand), because even when you buy, buy, buy into their eco-system, you could still end up with the problems I had, and waste a whole lot of money, your time, and get a lot of frustration trying to fix some unfixable problems.<br /><br />Threw the whole unit into the garbage, and went back to using my old brother mfc-j630w, which I got back up and working in less than 30 min.<br /><br />Sure the brother doesn't scan as well, doesn't look as nice, and doesn't quite print photos as well, but when I want to print something, it darned well prints, and quickly as opposed to that frustrating slow and often flaky Epson (that worked so nicely at the beginning and then became a demon).<br /><br />Now I'm happily printing on command, and much, much, more cheaply using my brother.<br /><br />Glad to be done with the Epson demon.<br /><br />Don't think I'm some industry person writing a negative review - I'm a real guy, who is pretty darn technically competent, but I'm just sick of wasting my time and energy on stuff that doesn't work - and I really, really wanted to Epson to work on many accounts, but finally just gave up and threw away a frustratingly unusable piece of gear (and a fair amount of money in gear and unusable cartridges).\n",

You buy a well designed, functional bib from the product design aspect and safety consideration of your baby, and not mainly for its \"cute\" appearance and certainly not for the bragging (those are adult parent's superficial wants out of the baby bib, and not for the considerations of the baby).     Just looking cute won't cut it. Safety precaution should always come first for your babies!  THIS BIB CAN BE A SERIOUS HEALTH HAZZARD when little Johnny gets a little too curious with that locking button.  He might want to try it out himself and chokes the helpless little one from behind when mom is too busy and not watching.  I am sorry; this is a major design flaw: The overall design concept using a locking button on a baby's neck is a BIG NO-NO!! It is unsettling thinking about the potential danger. I will not be too surprised when the child safety and consumer protection agencies are knocking on the door. I will not use it. Shall I say it has \"too many strings attached\" for me to consider.\n",

Clasp is OK and has held--but Ironically, the clasp is difficult to unclasp when desired.

      "I approached this movie with huge anticipation.  The director, Jee-woon Kim, has directed some PHENOMENAL Korean movies.  The cinematography in his movies I Saw the Devil and The Good, The Bad, and the Weird is simply some of the best cinematography I've seen in any movie anywhere (American movies included).  If you don't mind subtitles (and you shouldn't) check both of those out.<br /><br />So I was excited that Mr. Kim's American debut was going to be Arnold's return to the big screen.  The previews looked promising and fun.  But something about the movie just felt...off.  None of the action sequences were all that impressive or original, and you certainly don't go buying a movie like this for the plot and characters.  it also seemed like some of the risks and insane cinematography that the director had shown in some of his previous movies was absent.<br /><br />Overall, it's not bad, but if you really want to be entertained, check out the aforementioned Korean movies by Jee-woon Kim.\n",

The settings are very Nikon and once you fine tune all of the settings the camera will take nice quality images. Much better than my iPhone 5 that is horrible indoors. My only complaint is that the processing from photo to photo is a tad slow, but I'm used to my DSLR so I did not ding it for that. I like Nikon quality and this is perfect for the family to mess with and for the price I am not very worried if it gets banged up a bit. My favorite feature is that it takes normal AA batteries... that is a great feature.\n",

      "3.75 overall<br /><br />I started watching with no real knowledge of how BBC intended to interpret the legend though I guess I might have been expecting a more historically accurate look and tone (meaning darker and grittier) because that has been the trend with historical movies since Gladiator back in 2000, and you can see it now in stuff like Spartacus and Game of Thrones. Don't come to this Robin Hood series expecting that.<br /><br />In this first few episodes, the story is set up with some dark touches with the people starving, and King Richard's taxes bleeding everyone dry for the Crusades, and people facing penalties like getting their hand cut off for poaching in the Sherwood Forest. A soldier back from the Crusades has a moment of mental anguish from PTSD from his combat experiences. And Robin feels guilt when it looks like he might not be able to protect his \"peasants\" from the Sheriff. So, the serious stuff starts to get emotionally involving.<br /><br />But then there is far more of the cheesy, unbelievable archery stunts and swashbuckling. Everyone looks startlingly 21st century as in clean, scrubbed, well-fed, moussed and gelled, and fitted into the best, tailored costumes from the Props Department. Probably the most unbelievable character is the Sheriff of Nottingham, a total buffoon who mocks the heroes by making faces and mouthing their words in a snide tone like a five year-old. It is hard to believe that he has the competence to hold a position of authority and be a threat. In one scene, and I am not kidding, he rolls his eyes and says, \"Well, yippee.\"<br /><br />So, is this comic satire then? Stuff that you're not emotionally involved in at all? Well, there are those serious moments I mentioned, so the tone kind of lurches back and forth, at least for me. Jonas Armstrong is a little bit lightweight as Robin Hood, but he alternates nicely between twinkly kindness and some quiet moments of stern outrage. But Richard Armitage in black leather - oh,my god - is total intimidating hotness as the Sheriff's main thug Guy de Gisbourne, and he steals every scene with his glowering eyes and gravelly voice. I may keep watching just for him.<br /><br />Overall, I think this Robin Hood series is enjoyable as a cheeky adventure meant for broad family appeal. If you get impatient with historical stories that are not historically believable, you might want to stay away.<br /><br />Edited to add: I have now watched every episode of all three seasons, and have come to a much greater appreciation of the villains who really steal the scenes. The Sheriff won me over with his hilarious lines and demeanor. Actors Keith Allen (the Sheriff) and Richard Armitage (the Sheriff's henchman Guy of Gisbourne) are so good they almost seem to be improvising with each other in scenes to add little details of personality. The character of Much remains a delight and Allan A Dale gets a terrific subplot that plays up to his lovable con man personality.<br /><br />I would give seasons 1 and 2 a four-star rating. Season 3 gives more intricate costumes to the main characters (nice). It also gives Robin a haircut to make him look more macho than mousy (still not possible) and gives Gisbourne long hair so he looks like some kind of death-metal god (I liked him better with short hair but, seriously, man, the actor is so beautiful he can rock any look). The reasons I wouldn't give season 3 four stars is the inclusion of two really annoying new characters: the shrill and brassy Kate and the pompous and pushy Friar Tuck who declaims every single one of his lines as if it is a matter of the gravest importance. Also the fact that the less-than-compelling Robin is the only actor in all the episodes of season 3. Gisborne is absent from two and the Sheriff is absent from four or five. But I loved the guy who shows up to play Prince John for three episodes as a narcissistic creep, and I also appreciated the devious and complex new character of Isabella.\n",

      "Yea, it was fine and fun on its first week, but after that one speaker did not produce any sound and the other one shows no light at all. Well, I guess it was just for temporary fun of only a week.\n",
      "I got this as a birthday gift and I have been having a lot of trouble with it. My aunt isn't really used to shopping online so I guess she didn't check the device quality that closely. I'm still grateful, but I would not have gotten this had it been my choice.\n",
      "I was hoping that my little girl would enjoy this as much as I loved the classic Mario games but it seems that won't be happening. This has been left untouched after its initial use and my daughter is an avid gamer.\n",
      "The product itself is incredible but the price here is a little astonishing. If you have this at your local store, you should get it there instead.\n",
      "Fuse should be more durable and should last longer, but, it's convenient for DIY jobs and made me save a lot on repair services\n",

      "Unfortunately it got all rusty in less that 6 month after I purchased it. Good pull up bars seem to be really hard to find in general as it seems. I've tried several models by now and all were disappointing. I was hoping the York one would be better but to no avail. Would be nice if they actually offer different models in various price ranges, I would rather spend 50 pounds once than 10 pounds every year.\n",
      "Don't bother. Mine held a charge for one hour and has never worked since.  Amazon should be embarrassed to carry it.\n",
      "For the money I spent, the fan should run silently. On low its fine but on medium or high there's a roar which makes conversation or even relaxation on the patio very unpleasant. Disappointing quality.\n",
      "I ordered the xl size, but this size is very big for me! Material is good (50% Cotton/50% Polyester). Nice color -(Kelly). Price is very good, so I recommend!\n",
      "I should have had the sense to order a dozen of these, now I can't get one for my son's B-day, who by the way is a 5th year marine re-in listing and has discovered the love of fishing, runs in the family big time.\n",
      "I dont expect a printer this cheap to work forever but after just one year it simply starts to behave strange.<br />Takes now more than a minute to print a page, makes a lot of strange noises and often suddenly just powers of.<br />I wont buy Canon again. Its a simple decision.\n",
      "These bar pulls added a bit of class to my otherwise simple looking cabinets that had no pulls. The five inch is good for our space but if my kitchen was larger I would prefer maybe 7inch size. The quality is great and I am very satisfied.\n",
      "These high-grade guitar strings are engineered for long-lasting use and play time. These timeless strings keep in tune and feel pretty nice! It’s not likely that you’ll find a better product for a cheaper price. Go with these and you won’t be sorry!\n",
      "Handkerchiefs are well made. It does feel little thin when new but once you wash it, cotton tends to open up and feels soft.\n",

      "My midwife calls this book the worst case scenario book for all things pregnancy and generally makes you feel terrified at every week... I found this to be extremely true. I am a couple months in and already I've been scared of like 10 things. Really I think that you should listen to your body and talk to your doctor / midwife and let them do the diagnosis. This book is helpful but I think that it kind of takes away from the joy of the pregnancy process\n",
      "I like this, the chain length is perfect, but now I will buy one! Although this is a small chip in the neck region, I also found it satisfaction. :)\n",
      "How this has 4 star rating is beyond me. My WIFE even had to hide this \"game” from our daughter. We love playing games with her, but this thing, wow, thank God it was a gift, made it that much easier throwing it out in the middle of the night. First off, that Styrofoam contraption they show and make look like its stands perfect is way off, the Styrofoam, I assume, from being curled up in the box, retains some of that memory, there for it never stands like it should and was always falling over, very awkward. Then the actual game came, which was very boring and tedious. Save your money, give a bond or something useful to your child or if gifting.\n",
      "I was pleased to find out that the quality of the Sony cameras has not changed. I am still amazed by the perfection of the photos that it takes and I also appreciate the fact that it doesn't drain the battery very quickly. The recording mode is also top notch. I don't like the design, though.<br />the price is okay.\n",
      "This little camera works quite well and the night vision was better than I expected. I purchased this camera to monitor my puppy while I am working at night because it has night vision, and you can talk through it.\n",
      "This product does not work. There is no driver disc with it and it is not a plug, or it is defective. There is no disc to insert and it does not work from there even after inserting a memory card. You get what you pay for and I have gotten several products here that did not work now. Disappointed.\n",
      "I was going to do a trip in business class and wanted a carry on that would look good, aside from doing the work of holding clothes. I bought this one thinking I had the deal of the century: buying a good looking piece for an unbeatable price.\n",
      "I've had this for about a month now, while the quality doesn't seem the best it is still working.  Picking up too much background noise though.  The price is low but I would rather have paid more and gotten something with a higher quality.\n",
      "After powering up the speakers and syncing with my phone, there was a loud clunking sound. After that silence. Now the speakers won't even sync anymore.\n",
      "Kind of overly repetitive, range is very short and nothing too exciting really happens. Got extremely boring after a while. The music was fitting for the game setting but that's about all.\n",
      "What a great buy for only few bucks. My daughter loves the design and she's comfortable wearing it.<br />Great product!\n",

      "I hate to have to wear a belt but there are times when you have to choose between holding your pants up by hand and using a belt. This is the only type of belt I will use. It's universally adjustable and easy to work with.\n",
      "I love the size, the fit, the support. Everything except that the soles are made in such a way that they squuk loudly. Everyone at the gym laughs when they hear me coming! I am going to have to use them outdoors only from now on.\n",
      "I installed this product cause I heard that this is what I needed. I bought it off of their website. It worked at first but then stopped working. Then this ridiculous seller told me that I probably damaged it somehow when I was trying to figure out what went wrong and said I would have to purchase a new one. Do not buy from him! he does not stand behind his product.<br /><br />On top of this, the product was oozing some weird glue stuff out of it which should have tipped me off that it was an inferior product. I would never recommend this crappy seller to anyone. I hope anyone else reading this will learn from my mistake and not purchase this!\n",
      "Worst prefolds I have ever bought.  They are so thin they are completely useless. I will have to sew 2 together just to be functional.\n",
      "I guess there are just those smells that will never go away, but my place is a lot more tolerable now because of this.\n",

      "When the package arrived, I noticed that most of the seeds were no longer viable for planting. I was able to salvage some after some meticulous scavenging however, and managed to grow some sprouts. Even so, it took a lot of work and all my experience, yet I'm still not confident that I will get a tree.\n",
      "I love this watch. I just had one problem, it's a little small than I imagined it would be. You can say that it's my fault, but because of the picture, I really thought it's slightly bigger than what I'm looking at right now.\n",
      "They seemed smaller than is stated and they do not hold up very well. When i first opened the package, most were already starting to come off the roll. Needless to say, I didn't keep them.\n",
      "These are not as large as I had imagined they would be, but they are a nice quality and are comfortable. They seem to be well-made and are sparkly.\n",
      "The price is low but the ink makes up for that.  I've had some trouble with leaking ink on the plus side the printer is easy to use and being able to print from the card is nice.\n",
      "grandaughter will love this,she wont care if this part of it,other one was sold out,thats ok tho, got the game i black so its a win win situation here...got what i needed for a great price,it all works the same so color is not important to us.\n",
      "I have been using the 8 minute abs from the 1980s.  I have it on VHS format and the video is extremely old but still does the job.  The problem was with it being VHS i rarely ever did the routine again.  I got this DVD and it blows 8 minute out of the water.  So much that I cannot keep up.  I just try and go at my own pace, but really shreds your core (although with me you cannot see yet).  If you want an insane ab workout give this a shot.  If you can keep up then you are awesome!\n",
      "I saw the back on another website but they did not have the bag in black. I found the color I wanted at the store and I was also able to use my rewards points towards my purchase. The quality of this bag is excellent.\n",
      "Since I can not share links on amazon I highly recommend you search &#34;Import Alert 99-33&#34; FDA on google, you will see that FDA has revised it's import guideline from japan once cleared radiation products. Stay alert, stay safe my friends.\n",
      "I have only had this TV for a week, but so far it is working perfectly. The picture is beautiful, set up was easy. Well worth the price and it is on easy pay. I have been with them since they started and I can honestly say that I have only returned 1 item and they replaced it without any problems.\n",
      "This product seemed like it would be fine as my husband and I put it together. It only was missing two washers so we weren't too worried. The next day after it was all set up I went to use it. It was smooth and felt just like any other elliptical I have used. I did notice a bit of resistance when I was on it for about 20 minutes. I just assumed, &#34;well it's new maybe it has to be used a couple more times.&#34; Definitely wrong. Went to use the very next day, (don't forget, two days after setting up, one time of use!) and was completely annoyed to notice that something had to be grinding on the belt inside because I could barely move the pedals forward to get going. So we take that apart and peek inside and sure enough the darn belt looked as though it was about to come right off and was ripping. We called customer service at weslo and they proceeded to tell us that item is &#34;really backordered &#34; and we probably should take back to store. Thankfully we kept reciept and box for item. Seriously, don't waste your time or money with this product. Its a joke.\n",
      "Bought this at officemax because my AC adapter went out. I picked this over a Targus brand adapter because it looked cool and the vampiric power saving technology sounded cool, it isn't. This charger for some reason charges my computer for 5 seconds then turns off, no matter how many times I turn it back on it just turns off again, thinking my computer doesn't need energy right now or something, even though my computer is literally seconds away from dying.\n",
      "Good for a week trek. Efficient straps make the load distributed. The design of the side zips are not so good, possibility of struck when loaded heavily. Otherwise its worth in all other contexts.\n",
      "I searched several places for a reasonably priced bed that was still comfortable for my dog, and this met both criteria. I've been very pleased with this bed. The only problem is, if he digs the cushion out there's nothing soft for him to lay on once it's gone. He seems to love his new bed though!\n",
      "D-link works fine. Use it for work and can see what's going on while at home. But cannot get it to work wireless. Which I would love so I could move it around to monitor other areas beside the registers\n",

      "I bought these socks because mine were falling apart. I was looking for something that was a good price and had a great rating. These were perfect.\n",
      "This is an excellent gift to my little girls who have not yet passed the age to appreciate such things. Perhaps next year this will not be that interesting to them, but for now they like it.\n",
      "The delivery came on the estimated arrival day.<br />It arrived in more pieces than it should have, meaning broken.\n",
      "These are some of the best gloves I have bought in a long time.  I use them whenever I do work on my car or my wife's car. Or the lawnmowers or anything around my house.  They fit really comfortably and they have some grip to them to help hold them or grab them.  These will be on my list from now on\n",
      "It looked good here, but it's not very sturdy. Used it for one time and then stuff started falling off. And to think that I waited so long for it.\n",
      "difficult to install and get going.  tech support was terrible, and i couldnt get past a certain step, they couldnt either.  FINALLY after install, it loses wifi and just not reliable overall, pllugin is buggy.\n",

      "This isn't an optimism vs pessimism debate. When you pay for ink, stick it in your printer, and it reads 48% full- you just got ripped off. Don't buy from this company, total waste of money.\n",
      "As an amateur, the price of the DNA5050 thrilled me. After getting it, I had a change of heart with my purchase. Don't get me wrong, I think that it's great. The truth is, it  didn't really fit my needs but the price sold me. It's way cheaper than another stabiliser of similar make that I've been eyeing for a while and I guess it was an impulse buy.<br /><br />In any case, there's nothing wrong with it. I spent a few weeks getting to know this Glide Gear stabiliser--I particularly enjoyed the easy release mounting plate--but in the end, it was not for me (my cameras are on the smaller and lighter side of basic, most often used is a Sony pj200 camcorder) and carrying the 5050 for teeny tiny cameras just felt and looked stupid. I ended up trading it with a friend for oddly enough another Glide Gear product (the DNA1000), which had come out later.<br /><br />So all things considered, it was still a great purchase. I avoided wasting and losing out on an impulse buy, got a great stabiliser along with a few other things that matched well with my cameras, and I bagged a lot of good will too.\n",

      "I had the chance to play this keyboard from a friend in his own recording studio. All I can say is I like the keys, so soft and bouncy. Unlike other electronic keyboard which you really need to make an effort to push it hard so it can trigger the touch response scheme. But I like this one and planning to buy one even if it's used already.\n",
      "Great, light weight luggage. I normally worry about my luggage being overweight because I always over pack. Not this trip - I actually had room to spare for gifts to bring home - not to mention ten pounds to play with because the luggage is so lightweight..\n",
      "Not sure the thermometer is the best addition to this toy. Sure, it's cute and my kids love it. But that doesn't mean it's functional. Just give it as a toy, because I can't rely on the thermometer to be accurate when room temperature reads as hot. Why pay extra money when you can get a rubber duck at the dollar store for a quarter. Or a whole bathtub full of them for that matter.\n",
      "The webcam works easy, on my smartphone and in my office. Captures pictures and emails them to my Gmail easily. I will get some more when they go on sale! Would be nice to have a better one to pan and zoom. I love it.\n",

      "I have only owned it for a month but so far so good. Good picture quality, Light weigh, Good price Easy set up. This is my second product. I already have a 56 inch . I would highly recommend to both family and friends.\n",
      "It works well...when it works. All too often I can't log in. Never had this problem with my 360. Supports answer? Unplug it for 5 minutes then try again. Really? If it's a software problem, fix it. If it's a hardware problem, redesign it!!!\n",
      "I ordered these sunglasses because I loved the look and but the shape was wrong for my face. I have an oval face and these sunglasses have a round shape. I opted for a different style that had a slightly more rectangular shape.\n",
      "Once I finally got the product(it was coming from China),I tried to use it and within about fifteen minutes it had clogged and stopped working. I went back and looked at some reviews to see if it was just me and realized that I'm not the only one who had this problem, and it looks like it took about the same amount of time for it to stop working for everyone. It was a very low quality and definitely not worth the price. I won't be ordering from them again.\n",
      "The unit is small, which is good. You can put it almost anywhere. It vibrates a bit, so be careful that it does not move. You may need to put it on an abrasive surface to keep it from moving.<br /><br />The unit became extremely noisy after a few days. It sounded like popping popcorn in a microwave when set at all speeds.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend.\n",

      "The TV version of the Flash wasn't great; BUT it was the best adaptation to date for TV of a hero and came about during an era when comics were just starting to be recognized as a mature medium. On that scale, some of the plots here were a little hoky or campy and some of the Villains, too -- but the Flash of DC comics really didn't get serious and dark until its final initial run. John Wesley Shipp wasn't visually ideal as Barry Allan but he did a great job with some occasionally campy material as did an array of guest stars. Modern effects made it possible to bring the Flash convincingly to life, and it's well worth watching for any DC fans.\n",

They are easy to assemble once you get the first one done and get the hang of it but as said in previous reviews the lighting gives off a blue cast :( I look gray and blue and not well lit at all :( ALSO, I walk by them and just the wind from my body knocks them onto the ground, they are very flimsy and you would need to purchase sand bags as well as the lights in order to keep them standing up which is a big disappointment.

      "The authors of Hell or Heaven seem to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see it as a book at all.<br /><br />In \"How to Stop Believing in Hell\" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the Divinity of Christ, the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading.\n",

      "As a point-and-shoot camera, the L810 employs specialized technologies like face recognition, wink-activated shutter, and BSS (Best Shot Selection) to do the work of getting a decent exposure. These technologies give you a decent exposure, but sometimes with less than fine image quality.\n",

      "I purchased the DVD based off of all the instagram photos and celebrity transformations I have saw. Overall I like the DVD. The workouts are simple enough to do. You will sweat. A tip I recommend is to always put more into each set that you do for better/quicker results. I love how the mother engages you by being active through EVERY single workout. She pushes you to finish.<br /><br />As far as the daughter's workouts, very &#34;squaty.&#34; That's pretty much all she does, besides give instructions on what you should be doing instead of demonstrating. I love all the leg workouts she does in her segment, and I really love all the Ab workouts. I really don't watch her anymore, but I use the other lady in the back, Christy. She does everything. As she pushes, I push.<br /><br />Complaints: The low audio quality. The sound is drowned out by the background and my the music. You have to turn up the DVD to a higher than normal level to hear what is being said. Also there is some issue with the transitions into forms with Lana's portion.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, you DO NOT have to follow the meal plan associated with the DVD. I used my own regular foods, at a lower rate than I would normally do. I just eat smaller portions, and eat more (wise food choices) frequently. I can tell a huge difference in just one week of working out. You have to have SOME sort of diet or discipline. Just because you workout, does not mean you will lose weight, you must also watch you intake.<br /><br />Good luck ladies. You can follow me on IG if you like @XIjaneiX\n",

The first main issue I ran into was the fact that the auto focus system. I then noticed after looking around on the internet that it's a common issue with this model. Only about 1 in 10 pictures were taken correctly due to this focusing issue. I had tried every setting and adjustment but the problem still remained. Also, it would randomly shut off during use for no apparent reason. I just wasn't happy with the camera.<br /><br />I then did some research for a different model that I could be more confident buying so that I would be happy with it's performance during use. Luckily, I did find a way better camera and finally don't have to deal with the annoying issues the 70D had. Nearly every picture I take focuses correctly and stays on during use like it should.<br /><br />If you want a great camera, check out the same one I got here on Amazon ---------------&#62; http://amzn.to/WBF8So<br /><br />I hope I was able to help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did!\n",

      "I should have listened to all of the reviews I read about how this product does not pair well with the iPhone 5. Instead, I was captivated by the look and sound of the Pill and ignored the reviews, thinking they were all posted by anti Apple people. I was wrong.<br /><br />DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!!<br /><br />The Beats Pill is easy to pair with the iPhone and the sound is great. However, after 40-45 min, the connection breaks and the music stops. At first I thought it was a wifi problem or a problem with my phone app (Pandora). But, after repairing my iPhone 5 the problem continued. I switched to iTunes and had the same problem - the connection kept breaking. I used my son's iPhone 5 and had the exact same problem.<br /><br />I visited the Apple store (where they sell this item) and asked if they knew of any problems. Their reply - - \"We haven't heard of any problems and haven't had any returns\". Really? I find that hard to believe.<br /><br />I returned the Pill and purchased the JamBox and have NEVER had a problem with the pairing. Sure, the sound was better from the Beats Pill and the look is definitely more appealing. But, I am not getting rid of my iPhone.<br /><br />I am an Apple person and own iPads, iPhones, iPods, and MacBooks. So my review is not anti Apple. This item does not stay paired with the iPhone 5. If you own one, DO NOT purchase the Beats Pill.\n",

      "It is not clear what this book is intended to accomplish. It is a compilation of mathematical knowledge aimlessly stacked in an oversized book. The book is entitled Geometry but it covers most aspects of mathematics. The Elements and the Structure of geometry are not Set Theory. Of course a geometric object could be interpreted by the set theory, but geometry is not set theory nor is set theory geometry. This is as good as saying physics is mathematics. Interpreting a line as an infinite set of points denies the very essence of what is a line. Geometric object are visualization of physical things and it has rooms in our mind, infinity is a pure abstract philosophy of mathematics and has no room in our imagination. I do not recommend the book for learning a curriculum. It would be a good reference on the bookshelves.\n",

Normally I have a really hard time trimming him and this really seems to do a good job. My only complaint with this is, periodically, I have to stop during the trim, remove the attachment, and get the fur that is stuck. I am not sure if it is just my dog or what. It soesn't happen often but it certainly does. I love how this comes with a brush to clean up the blades. There are two different attachments included with two sides. Each side offers a different length. If you are looking for a quality pet trimmer, I would recommend this one.    This item was provided free for the purpose of inspection and review.\n",

      "If you are reading this review prior to buying and installing the product, do this RIGHT NOW - buy a 14 mm tap with a thread pitch of 1.5. My husband has worked on all of our cars for years. He is also a mechanical engineer. When we read all the reviews about it being a tight fit, we thought those people were being dodo birds.<br /><br />We put our 2009 Acura MDX up on car ramps and my husband struggled for two hours on a Friday night before giving up. There is too much build up to install this hitch without thoroughly cleaning all the gunk off and using the tap in the bolt holes under the vehicle. We thought we would get a tap on Saturday and get it installed. \"How hard would it be to find a 14 mm tap? We live in the Seattle are so it shouldn't be a problem,\" we thought. Oh. How. Wrong. We. Were. Places like Ace Hardware and Shucks Auto do not carry a tap that large in-store. They were special orders only. After calling a few friends out of desperation, we were referred to Tacoma Screw in Seattle and they had one. Machine shops are not open in the weekends, so that's why we had trouble getting one. It took five hours to track one down.<br /><br />Once my husband used the tap on all the holes, the hitch went right on. It was still a snug fit, but he didn't have to struggle.<br /><br />We have been using the hitch for about a month now. It looks good on the car and didn't require a special bumper trim piece. We are happy with the hitch itself and have used it to attach our Yakima Holdup bike rack.<br /><br />I also recommend buying the hitch cap if ordering the hitch from Amazon. It was under four bucks and gives the hitch a more polished look when not in use.<br /><br />The hitch arrived from Amazon on a Friday instead of Monday as Amazon estimated a three days sooner than expected. It was packaged in the original Curt box. It was supported nicely in the cardboard box and the hitch was wrapped to prevent scratches. The hitch was in pristine condition.<br /><br />This hitch would have gotten 5 stars, but I feel like there should be a recommendation from the manufacturer to have the tap on hand when you start, thus only 4 stars.\n",

I have a hard time believing any positive review about this product because there is nothing good about it.<br /><br />The screen hardly registers your fingers and when it does is calibrated way off of center.<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money and get a decent tablet I did.

      "2 Guns was a fun movie that I am certain to watch again.  It is a gritty CIA/DEA/Mil-Intel/Crime Thriller based around bank robbery money, drugs, and a Mexican drug lord.  While I find it silly that men can get shot in one scene and fight and stuff in the next, this was based on a comic book story, which I am sure had \"superhero-ish\" characters.  The comic aspect does not come through in the movie though, which was good. I recommend this one to ALL cop and military action/thriller fans. Great acting carries a \"comic book\" plot that has more twists than a roller coaster! 4 stars - MR\n",

After so many raving reviews, I was looking forward to putting this peeler to work in my kitchen,  But I was very disappointed when I opened the box.  The stainless steel finish on the handle was all pitted and scratched and did not look anywhere near as good as on the product photo.  But worst of all was when I tried to make zoodles.  The blade flew of the peeler on the first slice and I ended up cutting myself.  It looks like the blade was not even attached to the peeler.  This was a poorly manufactured peeler and I am left wondering why this product has so many 5 star reviews.  Into the trash it went.\n",

So many compartments which is what I like most and that lock feature for the top and side part is genius. I also love how they maximise the space it have, like the side compartment for necklaces, it have this small pockets at the bottom and still have hangers. Downside was, the box I received have some flaws and I blame the Quality Control inspector here. Some of the hangers are not properly attached, they are somewhat loose. The inside compartment of one of the drawers isn't aligned properly like the others so it has this uneven area. Mirror isn't clean when I opened it, I don't know how it happened.

      "Shopping for a camera can be overwhelming when you take into consideration all the mixed reviews about point-and shoot cameras. So, I decided to purchase one that was small to keep from wasting too much money on a camera that would not produce. After all, most of the rave reviews are given to very large and expensive cameras.  It was time to see if a mini camera could produce what it promised, and I felt like I had nothing to lose.<br /><br />This pocket camera proved to be an excellent choice. It has excellent shutter speed, very fast recovery in between shots, 10x zoom capability, low light capability, macro capibility, and nice video quality. In other words, it does exactly what you'd expect a \"point-and-shoot\" camera to do: take great pictures.<br /><br />However, it doesn't work well with the flash, and it has a very dark quality when recording video in low light. If you can handle using small flush buttons and going through multiple menu items to erase a picture or toggle between manual and automatic pictures, then it's worth your while.  After all, anyone wanting a compact camera is not asking for professional photography.  You just want something that's easy to carry that will also take good pictures.  This camera hits the mark.\n",

Unfortunately for me, the platform was so high that I felt it took away from the very lovely shape and look of the shoe, and took away from the attractive look of the the shoes when you are wearing them.  If you like big platforms, then you will find this a very nice shoe, that will be comfortable to wear.\n",

ALL of these people that wrote these five star reviews must either work for HP or SMOKE CRACK IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS. No one in their right mind would say they enjoy paying $20 OR MORE for something that probably costs less than $.50 to make (probably more like $.10 even after handling costs) and that can't even print out a short novel, or heck, a children's story for that matter.<br /><br />To the reviewer that said this black ink cartridge lasts 220 pages YOU ARE A FLAT-OUT LIAR AND/OR A MORON, and neither should be writing reviews and giving untruthful info to other people. The only way this ink would last 220 pages is if each page had a single word printed on it or maybe a single sentence. Maybe even a short paragraph. But no way in hell would one of these cartridges last 220 full pages. NO WAY, NO WAY, NO F-ING WAY. I do my own personal taxes, the taxes for my parents, and taxes for my own business. I print two copies of every return, one for my records and one for sending in (I don't e-file). I printed 38 pages this year, 2014. Let me spell that out for you: T-H-I-R-T-Y E-I-G-H-T P-A-G-E-S...And that's it! The ink is GONE. R-I-P-O-F-F<br /><br />I don't know what the solution is for this BS printer and ink problem we have right now, but I know it's NOT buying these HP cartridges because they suck!\n",

It does have a bright beam, but that's not so useful if you're constantly looking for parts that fall off of it...\n",
      "I bought these boots for my job as a privet security company. I do a lot of standing and needed a boot that breathes. I am giving these boots 4/5 stars due to a very rough and hard leather sole but all you need is a nice insole and you are set. They support your feet and for my preference it's perfect it might be different for other people but I was told you want good hard support. Just having a gel sole will ware and start to hurt. With these they cup your heal comfortably and have two vent holes on the inside portion of the boots. So in short I recommend these highly and I would advise you to buy dr.sholes or somthing to that effect because the boot offers you the support in which it should and the insole you buy is just the icing on the cake.\n",

Anybody with a hair across their ass can take it out on some artist. You paid $2.99 get over it big spenders. Yes, the movie should be better. I paid $2.99 and would not stoop as low as you guys to bash it that bad! No class!\n",

      "Visually, the earrings are beautiful. The stones catch the light and sparkle like they are expensive. But when you actually have to manuver the lever & put them on, the metal is very flimsy. Will easily bend the wrong way. You must be extremely careful with them. Also the overall earring is small when you hold it in your hands. Almost a little too small and delicate for an adult. The size is more appropriate for a tween going to a special occasion.\n",

      "This is heavily advertised on television but it is heavy for what it is and it is not sharp enough to open a can or envelope or to be used as a box opener.  The screwdrivers and wrenches are very limited and are also clumsy and hard to use.  The rulers work fine, but that's about it.<br /><br />The corners are sharp and will wear a hole in your wallet.<br /><br />You cannot fly with this, the TSA will confiscate it, there is no TSA approval for any kind of particular pocket tool like this.  Don't argue with them, or you won't fly.<br /><br />The price is also outrageous.  It probably costs fifty cents to make.\n",

      "My reviews on Amazon are usually very enthusiastic for the product I'm writing it for, but this magsafe adapter is horrible-- (oh yeah, and would spark and smoke). I do not abuse the wiring and my laptop stays mostly on my desk, except for the few times it moves to my bed or the couch; I rarely take it out of the home. Yes it sucks but what's the alternative? Get the expensive apple version? Look at those reviews! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B002TLTIS8  This time I used duct tape around the magsafe part up to a few inches to prevent the wire bending. Hopefully this helps and actually makes this POS have a life span of more than three months.   The new one is supposed to be flush with the laptop to theoretically cause less bending, but instead it spins around and around until the wiring shorts out. Of course each time I noticed it coiled I would fix it and try to straighten out the wiring, but after a few months of this, the wiring just completely quits conducting electricity.  It's absolutely ridiculous that I have to spend close to a $100 dollars every couple of months! I really could NOT care less how &#34;thin&#34; and &#34;stylish&#34; it is-- I want it to work AND for a respectable amount of time.  In summary, I love Apple, I have all their products, including the iPad, but their wiring (including the usb connections) really need new engineering.

Overall I just wasn't happy.<br /><br />I dealt with that and did some research so I could find myself a monitor I could be confident would be sufficient for what I was looking for and worked properly.

      "My mother in law gave this to her when she was 2 ½ and I immediately despised this thing. Number one, kid can't play on it, it falls over, number 2, KID CANNOT PLAY ON IT. What is the point of this thing? The other day, I was passing her bedroom, this thing nearly gave me a heart attack, in the corner of my eye, I thought there was a home intruder. If someone can seriously explain to me the reasoning behind this contraption? I would understand a small one, but this thing is HUGE and is a $100???? SAVE your money, get the small one! As far as this companies other products they do a nice job, I just do NOT understand the point of this thing.\n",

      "I got this treadmill hoping I could start being active and working out regularly but sadly I wasn't able to with this. The first thing I noticed was the fact that the plastic pieces on it felt very cheap and low quality for the price it's being sold. I felt that I didn't receive a well made product that they advertise. Also, it would randomly shut off during use and would lose all of my progress during a specific work-out. This happened no matter where I plugged it in.<br /><br />After I dealt with that, I did some research like I should have from the start and found a treadmill here on Amazon that I absolutely love. I've had it for about a month now and can't find a single thing to complain about. It feels well made and does exactly what it should. I use it as much as I possibly can and have never been happier with my health.<br /><br />If you want a great elliptical, get the same one I did here on Amazon -----------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1oJZdAr<br /><br />You obviously get what you pay for when it comes to this kind of stuff and I hope I can help keep others from making the same mistake I did in buying a bad machine.

      "I got this router hoping to upgrade from the cheap router I had from nearly 5 years ago. I figured for the price, I would be getting something that was decent quality and would get the job done, but it didn't. My signal strength was worse than it was before no matter where I placed it. I couldn't use it even a few rooms away in my house, which was very frustrating. Not only that, but it would drop signal as well randomly throughout the day.<br /><br />After I couldn't take it anymore, I did some research and found a router that I absolutely love! My signal strength improved by a ton and that made my internet speed so much faster! I can use my internet from any room in the house and even outside if I want to.<br /><br />If you want a quality router, get the same one I did on Amazon ------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1rLjrfe<br /><br />I hope I could help point others in the right direction and keep people from making the same mistake I did.

I kept seeing all these pictures online with the PS4 vertical so I had to get a PS4 stand.<br />Only complaint I have is that my grandma received the package for me and didn't tell me for 7 days!

      "This is a gift for my grandson. I thought that it might not be large enough for his wrist, but my husband put it on and he wears an 8 1/2 inch bracelet and it fit him. The bracelet is attractive and will go with most anything. I am not sure how well it will hold up, but am hopeful.\n",
      "This product did none of the things that it was supposed to do, including turning on. Seriously, it didn't do anything. Considering that this was a gift, I didn't think that I would be completely satisfied. But I never thought that it would actually NOT work!\n",

      "My mother-in-law bought this for my son. We are both disappointed with the product all together. Maybe we received a bad unit, but the positive reviews are overly enthusiastic which makes me skeptical. The quality of the workbooks are horrible. They were falling apart even before we opened them. All the contents are made from really cheap material. My mother-in-law was pretty embarrassed that she gave this as a gift. She had really high expectations for $100 (which is a lot of money for her since she lives off of SSI).\n",

      "Do not buy this. I repeat, do not buy this. Get a better one, get a bigger one, it doesn't matter.

Just read through the other reviews since they<br /><br />are saying pretty much what I'm saying.\n",
      "Looks nice but did not come with appropriate hardware. Also has a regulator installed that makes the hot water only trickle out.\n",

      "I bought this violin for myself, a beginner. The strings were terrible as was the case. I put on a set of Dominants and it had a great sound. I was impressed by the back of the violin, which was one solid piece of wood, not two. It is a very pretty violin to look at and listen to, however, there is a funny ring that comes from the E string which I just noticed.\n",
      "My husband and I are really nervous when using this every time since it feels a little too brittle to us. Since it's an electric object, taking the risk is really quite out of the question for us.\n",
      "The plastic felt cheap. I have never used them outside, so they may work ok. I just didn't like the cheap plastic feel of the frames. They also seemed loose on my head, so I gave them to my husband to keep in his truck as an extra pair.\n",

      "For small scratches this product definitely works. It fixed a lot of the fine lines that were located on the bonnet of my van which have been caused by small stones. But, for deep scratches (those that I got from different small accidents), it doesn't do a great job.\n",
      "I will rate this product with only one star because that is all that it deserve. My cat had it for a day and by next morning, it was in piece. She's not even that big. I can just imagine what a cat a few pounds heavier would have done.\n",
      "Firstly, I tried to pair with iphone, but wont get any connectivity. Later i tried with my tablet (Nexus 7) and it successfully worked. I got to know about Torque from google play which was used to pair the connection. Good scanning kit, small size and hard. Quite disappointed that about the iphone fact. Otherwise its fine.\n",
      "This particular model does not work for larger dogs. If you have a dog larger than 30 pounds, please do not buy this. My dog does not get contained. I spoke with others about this model and they have said the same thing. Its not made for medium or large dogs.\n",
      "The shelf came with great screws. It looks nice on the wall, and it serves a purpose. I was a little disappointed in how easily the surface scratched, the first time I put the printer on it. The metal edges are not well attached either, but that is not too noticeable except to me.\n",
      "Thoroughly enjoyed this movie – it was great fun and the actresses are sooo beautiful! It was worth checking out for Kristina Klebe alone..! Out of all the creature feature horror movies – this is hands down one of the best I've seen yet. All it needed was more mermaids!\n",
      "I thought I would save some money by getting the SwingTip instead of one of the more expensive swing analyzers, hoping the performance of the SwingTip would be good enough.  It wasn't.  It failed to capture most of my swings, but the biggest downside is that it doesn't work for putting, which was a deal breaker for me.\n",
      "While the light arrived quickly, it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. After putting it out in the sun all day, the light it provided was less than what I had hoped for. I assumed it was going to be brighter than it was. Maybe I got a bad one or I just had higher expectations. Either way, this wasn't what I thought it would be.\n",
      "This game is fun, and using the touch screen to use the light saber is very cool. However, the camera angles this game uses are not the best and you cannot change them. It's hard to see what it is that I am trying to hit, and I find that most times it takes about 3 to 5 tries before hitting what it is I actually want.\n",
      "I gave this a try and have found the tracking is really poor on it.  If you need any sort of precise positioning I would be staying away from this one.\n",
      "So this in the cinema and have to say, pretty disappointed.  The only good thing about the movie was H Berry, but beyond that it was predictable and lame.\n",
      "For beginners, this violin kit is perfect because it will introduce them into the world of violin without too much pressure. From here, they can move on to better violins with better quality, though they cost much more.\n",
      "It doesn't show the accurate weight. You have to step on and off a few times to make sure that it gives off the same measurement. It's really a hassle on my part.\n",
      "***These are obviously cheap food grade Mylar bags.***  They are not designed to be used for Electrical charges or protection from EMP in any way period. Electrostatic protection bags have at least 4 layers of conductive foil to protect sensitive electronics from charges via Faraday cage properties.\n",
      "I was really disappointed with this Julienne Slicer as it did not work as well as illustrated in the pictures. I think this product only works well depending on the size of the vegetables. I tried using it to julienne some carrots and because of this size of the carrots it was really difficult to twist and turn the carrot without breaking off. I also felt that a lot of the vegetable is wasted as it goes 'through' the slicer. The design of the product makes it look pretty cool though.<br />I would not recommend this product to a friend.\n",
      "I got this light as a gift for Christmas, and I am very happy with the brightness. Well some people may say that the light should be brighter, but I think it is eye-friendly especially when working in a darker rooms, it lightens the page just well enough and can be used for book reading at home or for reading dubbing lines as I do at work. In fact, the lights are just big enough and the idea that you can adjust which light and how bright you want it to be with the separate switch on button is very helpful - I use it when I want to focus on the top of the page only and dim the bottom by switching only one light in every lamp. I bought this also for my colleague!\n",
      "I read some reviews warning about lead contamination in Chinese Matcha. I read up on the issue. I found that lead contamination is certainly a big problem with Chinese matcha. Research done in 2006 by Han and his associates at the Key Laboratory of the Ministry Of China called &#34;SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA&#34; reported that 32% of 1225 samples of Chinese tea exceeded the MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE CONCENTRATION of LEAD!!! It is a real danger that we all should be aware of. Another study has shown that even organic green tea from China contains lead!!!<br /><br />Lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen, 1999). I understand that the contaminated water enters agricultural soil in water irrigation systems which obtain water from the river. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a definite risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!!!<br /><br />Interestingly, this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is much better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was &#34;not measurable&#34;<br />Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), nervous system (including the brain) and bones!!!<br /><br />The way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. In 2013, ConsumerLab.com advised people NOT TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until they are sure about the purity of the matcha!!!<br /><br />It says in the CUSTOMER QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS section that uVernal told a customer called Barbara Zaretsky that uVernal matcha is made in China. As lead contamination is a big problem in Chinese matcha, I believe that the actual laboratory report should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the uVernal so that we can all read the results and get some PEACE OF MIND! Until then, I am NOT AT ALL HAPPY to drink this Chinese matcha. Once I see the laboratory report uploaded on Amazon, I'll write more about this product.\n",
      "I only bought this thing cuz I couldn't afford anything more expensive, but it's awesome! The tunes come out just right and it's freakin' loud too. Not loud enough for an open field concert, but loud enough to get something out of practice.\n",
      "Well designed code reader. The product is easy to use and reading the code is quite easy.  The code can also be transferred to one's computer through the use of the usb cable that comes with it. However, the only downside is that the codes will not be stored on the computer after use. Overall, a high quality product\n",

I don't recommend buying this box right now but hey its matricom and they have a tract record of firmware updates. If you can deal with a lot of updates and some bugs here and there then this box is for you. If your looking for an apple TV experience then this box isn't for you. Install xbmc when you get it. The media center that comes on it is kodi and its not ready yet. Not sure why they put that on there but whatever. streams great and runs xbmc like a charm. For me its wort the firmware update hassles i like to see whats coming next.\n",
      "I was very unhappy with the design of this device. My nephew who is 11 months old was immediately irritated with the upper portion of it because it rubs against his face.

Plus it is way too overpriced at $34.95\n",

      "I've had this wind deflector for over a year now. Now, this deflector does block wind, but don't expect wonders here. The deflector reduces the wind when you drive, but not by alot. This deflector is a minor help.<br /><br />My only other beef is the deflector has started to yellow a bit. Perhaps being left out in the florida sun is too much, but the deflector has lost a bit of its original clarity. It reminds me of the first wash of a white t-shirt. By the time you wash it the 12th time, that white T-shirt is now taupe.<br /><br />I will say the deflector looks great otherwise, and I got a response to my email in hours, and that was cool.\n",

LOL Umm no. That award goes to JORDAN! Hakeem is the BEST center ever! This is a boring & misguided documentary. If Olajuwon, Ewing, Duncan, Robinson, Sabonis, Mutombo, Daugherty, Mourning, Divac, Smits, Shaq, etc heck even Yao was playing back in the Chamberlain & Russel days, when NBA was fractured & wasn't fully established- no 3 in the key, no shot clock violation, no 3 pointer, etc, only a few teams, the average height of a player was around 6'3,only a few Black players, etc. they could have average 50 ppg, 20 rpg, had 11 rings & scored 100 points. I laugh at the idiots who are comparing NBA in the 50s-70s to NBA from 80's til today. Wilt & Russel wouldn't stand a chance against PF & C that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Jordan said it himself that Hakeem is better than Russel, Kareem, & Wilt & stated that he will take Hakeem over any Center in NBA history & I agree. No Center in NBA history is more quick, agile, better shot blocker, the ONLY C that's top 10 in steals, better footwork & had better post moves than Hakeem regardless who you think his better. Can you honestly say if Russel & Chamberlain would have came in the late 80s & 90s when NBA was at it's peak at defense, PF & C position do you think he would have 11 rings & scored 100 points? People need get over the fact that NBA is 100 times more competitive than it was in the 50's-70's ESPECIALLY in the 90s. FACT IS NO NBA PLAYER HAS NOR WILL EVER HAVE THE IMPACT AND INFLUENCE ON NBA IN ALL ASPECTS THAN JORDAN\n",

Now, I don't see how any of them are real...<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that the pictures looked no where near 16.1 MP quality. They were grainy and very low quality. At first I thought it might be the settings but it was always that way no matter what I did!<br /><br />If that wasn't bad a enough the time it took to scroll through the menu was super slow. It was painful and I dreaded having to do anything with it. I thought for the price, I would have received something better.<br /><br />I could only deal with this for so long, so I got something different after doing plenty of research. I spent hours looking for something I could be confident that I would like.<br /><br />After owning the new camera for a month I can say I have used it pretty much every day. I love it!

      "Another Obvious Knock-off of Original 5-Star McPolo's BabySoft Bib    This brave seller doesn't seem to care if he is violating any copyrights or infringing on any trademark and patent protections. He is not even weary about offering a knock-off product of the highly acclaimed McPolo's BabySoft Bib, a quality product at Amazon most parents are aware of. Not only that, he just casually \"drives through all the red lights\" so to speak and \"borrows\" their product images puts on his own logo and calls them his own! Sorry it is what it is, this is stealing under broad daylight! More to that, the language he uses to describe the product is also just too obvious a copy from the originator's version, as if he does not have any imagination, enthusiasm or beliefs pushing his knock-off product, but just wants sales, sales and more sales. One more thing that I cannot swallow, and it is the final nail to the coffin: He even brave enough to \"borrows\" McPolo's customers' product reviews next door on Amazon, word-for-word and fabricates the entire customer reviews entries!! I give him a 5-star for his guts!! But I cannot stomach and condone blatant business misconduct in such a way under Amazon's nose. I wonder why they don't take actions against this seller, to be honest. Sorry, I will not buy this product at any price. Fair competition is ok, but this is just too much, too much in-your-face, unethical and it is totally un-American.\n",

      "BEWARE of LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE MATCHA!!! Last year ConsumerLab.com (a leading provider of consumer information and independent evaluations of products that affect health and nutrition) said that it is NOT ADVISABLE TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha!!! The only way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. I would like to see the actual laboratory report on lead content of matchaDNA Chinese Matcha. It should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the matchaDNA so that we can all see the results. Once I see the laboratory report on Amazon, I will decide whether or not to drink this Chinese matcha.<br /><br />I believe that lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China. Subsequently, contaminated water gets into the agricultural soil via water irrigation systems which obtain water from the River Yangtze. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a real risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!<br /><br />I was happy to read that this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was &#34;below the measurable limit&#34; :)<br /><br />The reason why we should all check the amount of lead in Chinese matcha before drinking it is that Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the BRAIN (causing learning and behavioural problems), heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), and the bones! It is important that we see the lab report. It is a food safety issue!!\n",

      "It's a very nice sounding system. It's very sleek and stylish. The only down side is there was a lot of wires to hook together and it took about 10-15 minutes to set up not including putting the speakers on the walls. Overall a good product.\n",

      "I am reviewing the Wubble ball on two levels:<br /><br />ONE, it's a piece of junk!  I bought one at Target.  I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed.  Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable.  NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles.  &#34;Lifetime replacement warranty&#34;  &#34;Do not return to the retailer.&#34;  Only problem, they want $7 &#34;handling fee.&#34;  BS!  Plus the cost of postage to mail it back.<br /><br />TWO, As is typical, since these are only found in Target stores right now, you have a few scalpers on Amazon and eBay who buy up as many as they can at Target (causing them to sell-out quickly) and then they offer them at twice the price.<br /><br />Amazon really needs to put an end to this Third-Party rip-off activity on their website.  It really degrades the whole shopping experience.\n",

      "Cello prices are very expensive in the DC area string shops, and many of them are Chinese made (professionally set-up).  My daughter's school orchestra teacher told us she needed to move up from her 1/2 (used) cello and I thought about the quest to find an affordable ($650) first cello for her, we actually drove hours to another state and had to puchase a bow.  If my child was a serious string player who practiced and played for the love of the instrument then I could see spending the money for the 3/4, however my child doesn't practice consistently and this isn't a full sized instrument.<br /><br />The sound isn't as good as my child's 1/2, more muffled than clear, no ringing end notes.  We replaced the strings with pro-arte brand strings and noticed enhancement in the sound.  Good, not great sound enhancement.  The E string broke while the adult &#34;helper&#34; was tuning in chamber orchestra, the pegs are stiff and tricky like most new string instruments.<br /><br />Tip, don't purchase the more expensive perlon core style (dominant) strings with this beast.<br /><br /> I then purchased the prelude strings in the red package, now we are talking.  I had forgotten my own lesson with the first cello after we had first purchased it, get the heavy duty strings that last for students (and helpers) who are still learning to tune.  The sound is brighter with the new red pack of strings, you can hear the cello, especially since most students get the cheap strings that are &#34;brighter&#34; sounding for their violins that tend to drown out the few cellos.<br /><br />The bridge is very thick and appears to be carved from a 2x4, however it gets the job done with little finesse.<br /><br />Price is the selling point for this cello.  The price is right and it is able play after easy set up.  Sound is deep and mellow.<br /><br />***I strenuously suggest getting better strings!, the ones included are more fishing line than cello strings.\n",

      "I recently purchased two world instruments. The product is as described. It has a lovely wood design and the tines are decorated with colorful pieces of metal. Although this is a functional instrument, I believe it to be one produced for souvenir purchase. Souvenir items are usually not tuned to the desired pitch and the quality of materials is less than those used by actual musicians.\n",
      "I got this to go camping.  It's an all-purpose kind of towel.  I even put it down on the nasty floor in the shower at the camp ground,  then washed it with soap it was ready for more uses.  Really handy for wiping dirty hands, face, etc.  Interesting material.  Works better than expected.  High quality and durable. Highly recommended.\n",

      "I have several watches from Seiko, Citizen, and Swatch. I'd have to say that this is a pretty decent watch (but not something I'd recommend to my friends). The timepiece doesn't look very extravagant. It's a good everyday watch.<br /><br />If you're on an event, I think you're better off wearing a different timepiece.\n",

      "It says in the advert &#34;100% USDA organic&#34; but there is NO USDA ORGANIC LOGO on the PACK! The USDA labeling regulations for organic food products state clearly that the USDA organic symbol must be displayed on the pack if a product claims to be USDA certified organic. ‘Accelerated Intelligence Distribution' (the distributors of matchaDNA) also claim in the advert that the matcha is “USDA, SWISS, EU and NOP certified organic”. Again, there are no symbols or evidence on the pack to support their claim (there should be evidence on the pack)! The distributors are MISLEADING customers into thinking that the product is certified organic by two organic certification bodies. Why would you not print the symbols of the organic certification bodies when the regulations say you must? No one is above the law. I think that this is a scam. This is totally unacceptable and unlawful! This gift has to go in the bin!\n",
      "I must have received the lemon in the line. The plastic area where the band connects to the face is very soft. Within days the plastic had already pulled apart and the band ripped free. Not sure why such a key area of the watch and the most stressed part of it would be plastic. Not recommended. The watch looks great, but looks don't matter when you can't wear it. Took it back for a refund.\n",
      "I bought this about ten months ago, we used it a lot last summer. It rusted within a month of getting it. I painted it with high heat paint and it still rusted all the way through within two more months. Wish I would have spent another fifty and got a better quality one because this year I have to buy another. Not cheap if you have to buy one every year. With that said they would be okay if you don't use them but a few times and clean them each time and store them in the house after each use. I will buy a good one this year though!\n",
      "Warm and comfortable, although there is no arch support so walking long distances in them would result in painful feet. They slip on and off easily. Cover the ankles when shoveling snow or cleaning off the car of snow.\n",
      "anybody who has had this more then a couple of month i am sure would agree that there floor mats start stripping rubber, they become thinner and thinner before you know it they will have a hole in it, this is the second time i bought this after i was told it was just a manufactures defect  and this happened both times\n",

      "I thought this was a great buy for the price. I love the size of this rolling duffle and it has great pocket space, however it does not roll. The wheels just slide across the floor no matter what the surface. I was a gift to my daughter and she is really disappointed that we will have to be replacing it.\n",
      "In the end, I felt like these were just okay. I was hoping for more, and they aren't holding up as well as I thought they would. They work pretty well on copper, but not on heavy duty metals.\n",
      "Great build quality fits with the controllers and PS4 very well, I like the idea of charging and cooling simultaneously in a very less time, no time consuming at all.\n",
      "I bought this item from a used seller and the only thing I really have to complain about was the motion controlled games aren't as fun as their cracked out to be. Was shipped in a quick timely matter!\n",

      "I did not have any special expectations other than that the product work, and not fall apart. The belt separated from the buckle after about a week and a half. I have already disposed of the receipt and shipping materials, so I guess I will try and glue them together.\n",
      "This is a useless piece of junk and I'm glad I got it for free, otherwise it would have been money wasted. When I saw it, I could already tell that I wouldn't get any use out of it and I was right. When I held it, the plier felt incredibly flimsy and unreliable. You don't want this.\n",
      "This is disposable which is to say that it will not last you as long as you would have liked. That might be for a week as is the case with me, or it could be for a year. Either way, you'll like find that this is not all that durable.\n",
      "It works ok  my dog didn't really pay attention to it  maybe im doing it wrong but will see I'll keep u updated\n",
      "These are good design; however the colors are different on the boots. One of the boots has black shading on the \"badge\" and the other boot does not! Kind of as though it was bad printing.\n",
      "The very first complaint I have is that you cannot secure the zone wires to the controller with any reliability .  They are push connectors and not screw on.  Second the customer support people do not know the product.<br /><br />You cannot skip zones when you have the all zone remote programmed.  In other words you cannot say do all zones skipping the empty ones.  That means that the pump has to run.  I guess if you had a system that did not need a pump you would just time through the zone with no connection and everything would be ok.<br /><br />I am tearing out the system and putting a rain bird system in that has a better range to the remote.  I am on 1 acre property and the unit does not reach 300 feet.<br /><br />Consider purchasing quality and you will not have the headaches I have had.\n",
      "After binging on seasons 1-4 in a single week, my wife and I finally sat down to enjoy the glory of Season 5.<br /><br />After watching the first 5 episodes, my wife turned to me and asked me if this season was meant to punish us because we were Community fans and we wanted a fifth season. I mean, Dan Harmon may be back, but the stories aren't what they used to be. The light-hearted escapism prevalent in the past have been replaced with something very heavy-handed and trying too hard.<br /><br />The other reviewer was right. It's probably time for everyone to leave Greendale. Just wrap it up and quit while they're ahead.\n",
      "Purchased one about 8 months ago, took total of 3 trips only. Although features are great, the quality is very poor. The zipper has busted in seams. I would not recommend this luggage for neither weekend nor Business travels.\n",

      "We had a road trip to Disneyland from AZ and with three boys ages 5, 4, and 3 lets just say that was a real lifesaver! I don't know if it was an issue with all the models but when ever there is an interruption in playing (like pause or stop) the screens go to sleep and the secondary has to be turned off and switched on again.\n",
      "This camera came as a huge disappointment to me. This is not a good camera. My 11 year old 2 Megapixel Canon IXUS produces much better result. This camera is only good if you are in bright daylight. Even then the pictures are so grainy. Don't be fooled by its appearance, the touch screen is useless, non responsive and non functional. Its unnecessarily complicated. Don't even think of comparing it to any APPLE touch  screen.  If you want a simple good point and shoot camera, go for CANON. I don't want to look biased but I think SONY lost its glory.\n",
      "This is so stylish. I also feel sexier while wearing it. You can wear it with skirts or jeans. It fits my feet as expected. Lastly, I adore the black color!\n",
      "It is not the bag yo see on picture. Very cheap, thin leather.<br />Look like a second hand bag. I tried everything to get out the horrible smell, but nothing is working.<br />Very disappointed.\n",
      "Exactly what I was looking for the wallet case. It works very well, the color looks good, very small, very possible love.\n",
      "I was in the mood for an action movie so I watched the blu-ray on this one. It was an action movie and not much else. Lots of things blue up and looked good doing it. Lots of people got got. There was a lot of action. The plot was flimsy all all counts. The acting was meh.. thought eh main character, Jed, played a credible role.\n",
      "I love my bag. I carry it everywhere. It is chock full of stuff including my IPAD. Love Love Love the color. Zipper across the top lets me keep stuff in. lol\n",

      "I was very impressed with the sound quality of this guitar, but the craftsmanship lacked, specifically cosmetically. There were just to many cosmetic flaws/issues in the finish of the guitar, that I returned for credit. I am a very picky person and the quality of this guitar just did not meet my expectations, but what a nice sounding instrument. It's to bad, because the sound quality was excellent.\n",
      "I have never received anything from here of this poor quality. It's not worth my time and effort to send it back - it just won't turn on after having 3 adults try. It's like throwing money down the drain.\n",
      "I ordered this phone as I need a basic phone to use for my door intercom. The wire that is attacvhed to the handset does not go into the base, it ghets puleed directly into the wall and the base is a separate item that easily falls on the floor leaving the phone off the hook and no way for me to know if it rings\n",
      "I had a cup of product the morning before I got it and when I tried it, it tasted absolutely terrible. What the heck happened? Did they change the formula overnight? Did I have the last cup of the original?\n",
      "Charged these and used them for less than an hour before the battery died. They would not accept another charge, and I was never able to get them to turn on again. Overall they appear rather cheaply constructed. On/off and volume buttons felt flimsy. I wouldn't have been surprised if the control buttons broke, too, very poor quality, so many reviews are cheat customer. Amazon cant admit this seller sell again\n",
      "This design is great, the morning I use when running , look good , there is no hard , with a very comfortable\n",
      "I bought the black pumps and they worked perfect with my slacks for work. Fit true to size. And pictures were accurate to the onsite image\n",
      "I bought these because my fingers get really cold in the winter. When they arrived, I opened them to find that they actually don't cover your fingers at all!!!! So I can now pay $**** to return gloves which don't even cover my fingers let alone keep them warm.\n",
      "I saw the promo for these blocks and purchased several sets because I thought it was a great price. I'll admit, I failed to read the fine print that said they are only 12\"x12\" and I thought they were the 36\" I always bought; I didn't even realize they came this small.\n",
      "It worked well for about a month, and then got progressively worse. It was totally useless after about 2 months. Unfortunately the warrantee period is 30 days. I would be very leary about purchasing any electronics from here.\n",
      "nothing like photo paper thin no 4&#34;.  wow so disappointed to pay this for a bed.  There is no way cover would hold up to one washing as the entire under side is not the plush velour fabric but a paper type net almost that you could poke a finger thru.  wow skipped on fabric no fabric on bottom of bed just mesh can you believe it.  going back now.\n",
      "I returned this item as soon as I opened the package.  How can they named this product &#34;quilted&#34;, this is synthetic material embossed with a diamond shape patterns, cheaply made.  I am very disappointed with Amazon selling a product that's misleading the consumers.\n",
      "The quality of the item overall is great. The rubber cover is somewhat pointless; as its just cosmetic and cheap looking. The hose that comes with this unit is very poor and from the packaging may take some time to shape normally. I'll probably pick up a better quality hose to use with the hand shower.\n",
      "I had to wipe the computer chip several times on the first ink cartridge I installed. Once I got the first cartridge recognized by the printer, the others went in smoothly. Occasionally I will get the message that the printer does not recognize an ink cartridge, but for the most part the cartridges are working exceptionally well.\n",
      "This is a poorly designed product. Doesn’t work as advertised. Do not buy if you are planning to actually see something.\n",
      "I could only wear it once since it showed since of almost breaking. It’s okay though since I needed it only that one time for a play. I looked great and did great, and this thing played a huge part.\n",
      "I got this pool hoping to have something big enough for my kids to use and have fun in, but that's not what I got. First, it was extremely complicated to setup the whole system. Once I did get it set up and started filling it, I found that it had TWO leaks, not just one but TWO. I emptied the pool and attempted to fix them but it just didn't work. Overall I just wasn't happy and felt guilty for buying it.<br /><br />I dealt with that ordeal and then did some research to find a pool that my kids would enjoy and would show up in good condition. Luckily I found a great pool here on Amazon and have never been happier with it. I am glad my kids have something to enjoy this summer and I really can't find a single thing to complain about in over a month of them using it!<br /><br />If you want a quality pool, get the same one I did here on Amazon --------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1p5nq0k<br /><br />I went ahead and got someone to set this one up for me since the other one was such a pain but it was totally worth it because my kids love it and it has no signs of a leak!\n",
      "I purchased these fishing rods to be used by my grand children and was disappointed at best when I received them. Rods were very flimsy and the reels were poorly assembled I suspect that they will be used once, if they last. They are a one day disposable item.\n",
      "So....I got this item as an add on item because sure I do love peanut brittle so what the heck.. this is cheap enough right? I ended up just giving it away to a coworker.. There are almost ZERO peanuts in this thing....The picture does its justice... Look close.. like 2...I ended up buying a different one off amazon and was much more happy..

      "At first it did exactly what it was supposed to do. Decent sound quality, battery life left something to be desired but that was ok because I really only used the speaker when I was doing things in the bathroom/getting ready in the morning. However in the following weeks the battery life got worse, to the point I couldn't unplug it and now the speaker is pretty much unusable because it keeps cutting in an out while connected to Bluetooth.  I would not buy this product again and I would not recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "Has this company even tried their product? It tastes awful. I would suggest Vigilant Eats cereal for on-the-go vs this one.\n",
      "This is a superb product. Due to continual use--over 10 years, the shine on my car is unmatched. The product is built into the paint so that I only need to wax every six months or so.\n",
      "Antonella herself wears large size bracelets and when she presented this watch as great for larger wrists, I thought I was in good shape. When it arrived I found I could wear it only on the last hole and it fits more snug than I'd like. There are no longer bands available for it either. Not sure if I will keep it.\n",
      "This is OK TV, my 5 year old just like it for a while, not too fun, video quality is so so, I don't recommend it...\n",
      "Finally opened the box 2 months after purchase. Camera died within minutes after setup. Contacted foscam and they have not yet responded for days already.\n",
      "My last hand blender lasted 12 years. This Oster 2619 350-Watt 3-in-1 Hand Blender, Chopper, and Slicer, Black stopped cold after only 10 seconds. Total garbage!\n",
      "Son received a guitar for Christmas. Seems it either was leaning on the wall, scatching it, or on the floor. This was just what we need. Good price & good product.\n",
      "Overall, happy with the unit due to the price, it plays ALMOST every file, some it doesn't, which I then have to convert on my PC, other than that, good player.\n",
      "i guess after watching the other movies it makes this one of lower caliber... i just feel they could have done more..\n",
      "I have always fancied recording my own music and that is why I bought this microphone. It works just fine with my laptop and the sound recorded is pleasant to the ears. This mic made my dream come true.\n",
      "this frame was nice the first two days then it bent and the little in-between wires are now sagging. I am returning it.\n",
      "THIS IS A CHEAP ITEM! MADE VERY CHEAPLY, NOT WORTH THE<br />PRICE AT ALL. FINALLY, MOST OF THESE POSITIVE REVIEWS<br />ARE PHONY. THEY WERE PURCHASED. BUYER BEWARE !!\n",
      "My girl asked to see this, we did, and it sucked. I didn't even pay attention that closely but she did and she was fuming the whole time. She said it didn't meet her expectations in any way. As for me, I didn't really care.\n",
      "Nice for the price. Outside durable. Inside, wheels and handle could be more durable. Love the color.Good value for the money\n",
      "Not the color that I expected. I am very disappointed, that was such a big money to spend for this pot\n",
      "Seriously? It looks bad that I cant  use it as display case for the rings I sell. Once pressure is placed on the fake leather, it leaves a print. It's only good to store the rings, but then again, the holes were not properly slit, so the ring kept popping out.\n",
      "After Skyrim was released, it was really popular. I wanted to try it since a lot of people I know recommended it. Most of the stories were betrayal of people and there was always a twist in the quests that's why I loved the game. The graphics is great too and there are mods if you want better textures but for me, it's already fine the way it is. I have it in my PC with my graphic card Radeon 5570 and the game works just fine and I was really happy when it was released in PS3 since I could see better visuals of the game. The game didn't disappoint me and I'm really happy with it. The only thing that bothered me was that there were bugs and I really hate updating. Still, the wait was worth the game. It just got harder for me to adjust to its controls since I'm used to using keyboard and mouse for this game. Still, its epicness is worth the wait. Great graphics, great story.\n",
      "Great looking radio but the quality is less then great. For the price that I paid, I feel I should have gotten better quality.\n",
      "The only thing wrong with this bag is that the material is thin and can be torn with rough handling. But it gets the job done for the price.\n",
      "If you are expecting to stream movies be prepared to suffer through it dropping its internet connection every three or four minutes. It simply does not work on a wireless network even when I can be streaming the same movie on a laptop right next to it.\n",
      "zipper broke right out of the box, has plastic zippers break easily.  I opened it up and un zipped it to get inside the pet inside it and zipper broke.<br />Then once got past that zipper on rain cover broken the cocoon zipper was plastic as well and had separated and could not get them back on track.<br />I can't imagine paying this much for a product to put plastic cheap zippers on the things.  ONCE THE ZIPPER does not work anymore the item is no good.  The basket pod itself is sturdy but limited use with out working zippers.  I wish the manufacture would redo the zippers and put better quality on them.\n",
      "the clips broke when i tried to install them,  they are not 16&#34; they are more like 15.5, i had to take my wheel of and tie it with zip ties , the color is not crome its more like grey, they ended up breaking, what a waste of time and money, never ever buy this product\n",
      "I had a old Vito from the '80s one child is using and is as good as new minus a little cork on the mouth piece.  Still works and plays nice.  Plastic is in great condition.<br /><br />Another child wanted to learn the clarinet so we picked this instrument up.  It works, plays fine.  Good for a student to learn on.  Good price.  The only problem was the mouth piece was not smooth at the top where the reed sits and your mouth touches.  We picked up another mouth piece and that fixed the problem.  Child was able to play without hurting their mouth anymore.<br /><br />That said, comparing my old Vito with this instrument really shows the difference in manufacturing practices, for the worse.  The Vitto was a student instrument and it looks so good compared to this brand.  The Vito is easier to play.  You don't need to force as much air through to get a good, clear tone.  The tone of this clarinet is deeper, need to adjust mouth and breath to get be in tune with electric tuner teacher uses.  Not a noticeable problem unless you have another clarinet to compare against.<br /><br />If you aren't certain your child will stick with this instrument, go for it.<br />Beginner, go for it,then upgrade as they advance.  Better instruments do make a difference in sound.\n",
      "I really really wanted this to work--but it is just plain junky. By that I mean almost everything falls right out of it when it's in your purse, which makes it pretty useless. Very flimsy, too. I don;t know how they were able to take the photo, it must have been stuffed with cotton.\n",
      "These seem far too thin to be suitable for our dog. I'm worried that he might choke on them. Not going to use these at all just to be sure.\n",
      "Well I bought these for my 4 yr old niece, but since it was too small did not gift it to her, the screws are too small n very easy to lose, the screw thread is also not well made. But overall they are cute.\n",
      "The strings I was sent were not in individual packs as shown in the photos. They were simply bundled together.  GHS markets its strings as being in freshness-sealed packs. I consider the seller to have materially misrepresented what it was selling.\n",
      "Great purchase, The keypad makes searching for Youtube videos and making signs in easier than before, nice to have one, as for the headset, it is also good.\n",
      "Since getting this, I haven't used it all that much except for some initial expression of appreciation. This is a beautiful bag. I'll get to put it to the test this weekend though.\n",
      "this watch looks great and i get a ton of compliments on it. it also looks like the expensive kind. the only problem is it stains my hand with the metal\n",
      "Normally this is a great help. I am handicapped and shopping online is a tremendous advantage, but this time I was disappointed. The ink is light and won't print a clear vivid picture. I have a new grandson and can't get one good picture printed.\n",
      "Colors do not match photo. if you are getting this carpet because of the colors-don't, especially if you are decorating around these colors. They are not what they appear to be in the photo. I'm not sure what's up with the photo or if it's even the same carpet.\n",
      "This clipper has a fixed blade system or will cut hair very, very short only. You can't really use this to cut the body hair of the animal. The attached clipper comb guides are useless and do not cut very well. It cuts very well without the comb guides.\n",
      "I really liked this movie but I do understand why some people did not like it. The first 20 minutes of the movie was unnecessary but that is just my opinion. Also, the griffons scene made it look like they could've just used that the whole time. Another thing that people might not have liked this is the fact that it only built up for the following movies.<br /><br />My suggestion for people who have not watched is to either watch it now and wait for the next movies or watch it when the next movie comes out. But for me, I suggest you guys just watch it especially if you are a LOTR fan.\n",
      "Yeah i know, it has really good animation and stuff, nice suit etc, but you cant compare it to the other two parts.. i mean this sequel has a villan with absolutley no background story.. the guy shows up, has some kind of fire/lava power, that he got from some mutation and thats it.. and ironman (tony stark) is 70% of the movie without his suit, so they tried to dramatize it a bit, but there was no finesse.. As i said good, but not what i have expected for a last part of a triology.. Still got to have this one so i could complete my collection..\n",
      "I love this watch and have gotten several compliments on it. I also love that the face on it is so easy to read and it's very pretty. I have the platinum polished watch since I'm wearing all sterling silver now and it goes well with all of it. Can't beat the price on this watch!\n",
      "i got one of these during an xmas white elephant exchange.  there was an apple tv there too, but one of the nerdy guys said to get this wd live instead because it was better.  so the cool thing is i can play any files, movies, songs, on it.  the bad thing is doesn't always work.  the internet connection goes out sometimes, and then it is sooo frustrating to use, it takes my son like 30 min to fix it each time.  it is nice listening to pandera on the louder tv speakers instead of my laptop.<br />so my friend got the apple tv and it can only play a few different file types, so that kinda sucks.  for the same price get the wd live, but make sure someone is techie and can fix it if it stops working!\n",
      "mine come with no instruction, can hardly install it with instruction as there have 5 pins, don't very sure which pin to connect.  one of the  led burned in one week, do not last long, but daystar have 5 years warranty.\n",
      "It is very bright as advertised, but the construction was poor. Almost immediately the rubber grommet and on/off switch became ensnared and after resetting several times the grommet was removed. This rendered the light usable for a very brief period until it began to short circuit.\n",
      "I'm not really good when it comes to electronics but this has been a lot easier to setup than most. Granted, there are still parts of it that I don't get, but I'm getting there.\n",
      "Beautiful watch, only negative is the face is a little hard to read, but who cares? It's a good, solid, metal that looks like you're wearing a gold bracelet. To me, looks are the most important and this watch works for me.\n",
      "Every now and again something will come into your life that is supposed to make it easier but instead turns every minor task into an epic battle punctuated by such filthy cursing a teenage boy would start taking notes.<br /><br />This Bisssselll should be erased from the face of the earth. The filter... oh don't get me started on the filter. Try as you might to clean the dirty thing, it is engineered to leave you bloody and covered in dust while it remains unmoved and filthy.<br /><br />This is a beast of a demon that should be put down. I hate it. I'm changing my star from 2 to 1 because that's the truth.\n",
      "My son is 18 months old, and he can open the toilet seat even when the lid lock is supposed to be closed. He yanks the latch backwards so that it loses its grip and the seat cover then pops open. We have a standard toilet and the seat cover is flat with the angled edging surround. I am very unhappy with this latch and am looking for a replacement lock.\n",
      "i had planned for a trip to france with my family and had to purchase a big bag which could fit cloths for me and my daughter,i purchased this bag it fitted and was glad for that but on our way back the zip was worn out.\n",

      "We bought this model just last year and up till now we enjoy that HD quality it delivers. Simply fabulous! Every inch, hair, wrinkle, make up, teeth stains on the actors/actresses face can be seen without a doubt that it is what we thought it would be. As for the SMART option of Samsung it is also great but sadly it sometimes lag? We don't know if it's just the TV or it's our network having problems. Other than that, the only con I can tell everyone here is that one sickness thing Samsung Smart TV's have - the auto restart/shutdown thing. We've been experiencing this at random times so we can't tell anyone here how long it would restart and such. We reported it to Samsung and they told us that we're not the only ones having the same problem. We updated everything and checked every settings. Eventually, the restarting thing wears off and like nothing happened. Still, we experience restarts but with it happens rarely now.\n",
      "I just got it and used it once. It survived two plane trips and a cruise and still looks new. So far, so good! I definitely plan on buying more in the future--haven't seen better prices anywhere else yet.\n",
      "Better read dimensions carefully coz the bags are much smaller than they appear to be in description but if you know how to pack well you should be ok with a week worth of garments no more than that the bag does expand so you make be able to fit a week and 2 days worth of garments you will need another bag for your shoes\n",
      "This is a game in line with previous MOH series, but I felt this one just lacked substance. Missions are too short and not engaging enough. Ok to play occasionally I guess.\n",
      "I hate it. Did not work! Totally useless and waste of money!! Don't trapped by the fake 5 star reviews!\n",
      "If you plan to use this more than once a month get a different one. After a few days of use the latch stopped latching. The handle also came loose so have fun carrying it full of paperwork. Very flimsy, I would not recommend this product to anyone.\n",
      "These are really a good purchase.  The colors are quite darker than the picture. The rose gold kinda looks like copper.  But still for the price. This is a steal!\n",
      "I bought it for my Dad, when he tried to adjust the time the screw was broken and the battery was down.<br />It was an embarrassing situation.\n",
      "It holds Samsung galaxy completely, the holder can be opened or closed at any time, and it feels pretty secure.\n",
      "I love Zelda but it really is just a remake. It looks beautiful and is a classic but I would have expected a couple of new things to it. But ohwell, it is what it is and its a brilliant game.\n",
      "the flowers look more like stars and they are ironed on so after a week or so they come right of then yu will have a set of plain black floormats with black marks on it\n",
      "I am not a professional photographer but wanted something to carry my ever expanding tech stuff and protect it. I actually like many things about the bag but two things really have been a disappointment for me. The first is the \"sling\" nature of the pack. It just doesn't want to stay in place. Secondly, the center strap on the top of the pack has pulled loose! Appears not to be properly fastened and with very light wear and tear it has come loose again.\n",
      "This is a very nice looking timepiece and is constructed with good quality; however, I am sending back because it is just too big for my wrist. I'm right handed and the screw on pin cover digs into the back of my hand.\n",
      "the product was not delivered. I appreciate the money back. It's been a long time since I bought the product. Only lacking a unit\n",
      "This is just for precaution since I like taking my guitar all over the place and I don't want to just set it down wherever I can just because I couldn't bring the stand everywhere.\n",
      "I like the color but they do stick at all. Which makes them completely worthless for what i needed them for. What a waste of money.\n",
      "It is not going to win any awards, but a great movie out of the 80's. Mr determined has a very bad week.\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter who is in the beginning stages of learning keyboard/piano. It is a great starter for her and she is really enjoying using it.\n",
      "I had high hopes after looking at the photo of the matcha. But when it arrived it was much duller and lighter green. It is hopeless for making tea with - it comes out very bitter. It might be ok in a smoothie. I will try that another day.\n",
      "The packaging was great. I received it by regular mail a rather long box. As i opened it, it revealed an elegant box. It looks jaw dropping. But like I said above I was a bit disappointed at the beginning, which that feeling has obviously changed over time.\n",
      "Apparently, this is not a very good shopping bag. We gave this to our aunt but she says that the leather is of low quality and the seams are liable to open up.\n",
      "Don't waste your money on this product. It's made of cheap parts that are unstable and don't work. The attachments wobble and come apart. Customer service is the worst ever. Even if you end up with a defective product, they won't refund the shipping costs. Search other reviews and you'll see it's a waste of money.\n",
      "I was quite excited when I received the Surroundcast. I have been waiting for them for almost a week. After setting everything up, I started to play my favorite movie. However, the volume coming from the speakers was very faint. I tried to tweak the settings and also adjust the volume at my home theater receiver for the rear channels. Unfortunately, I'm still not getting enough volume from these speakers. So I ended up returning this kit and hard wired my speakers to my home theater receiver. Quite disappointed.\n",
      "I recently purchased this bag for my daughter who is going on a week - long trip to Florida. The bag is a great size and beautiful color! The pockets are an enormous size and the inside is very roomy. I would definitely recommend this bag for a friend. I absolutely would buy this bag again in a heartbeat!\n",
      "I don't need the Smart TV feature as I get all the facilities through my provider. The user controls for the menu are not brilliant as is common with Panasonic, but overall for a decent HD 50\" TV. The sound is certainly superior to the old set. It does take a while to set up and get the picture to your liking and if you're using terrestrial channels I would suggest a good signal since the picture is not as sharp as through my cable.\n",
      "This is false advertising.  First when I tested the levels 3 to 15 it produced no shock. I didn't think that this was a big deal because my dog is only 25 lbs. When I had to use it on my dog it yelped and started shaking with level 1.  I then hooked up a multi-meter and check the amps and voltage output and found out that levels 1-100 all produced the same level of very strong shock.  So I went online ang googling and see if I'm doing something wrong and the search point me straight to some Youtube videos.  I have found out the 100 levels advertised are not really 100 levels but 100 different frequencies so that the remote won't interfere with other radio frequencies so basically this collar has only 1 level of very strong shock.  Upon further reading the other reviews, I see 1 buyer also had the same complaint that the collar has only 1 level of strong shock.  To me this is a very dangerous collar that could hurt your dog.  Please buy at your own risk.  I will be returning this collar and get the Petsafe brand at my local pet store.\n",
      "Why are there even reviews for a product yet to be released? If you can read this review, you have an internet connection and therefore every problem that will be stated for the Xbox One is irrelevant to you. Yes, you must connect to the internet once every 24 hours to play this is not a problem for most.\n",
      "We purchased this TV for our bedroom to hang on the wall and could not be happier. It was an easy mount and setup and the quality is superior. We have an older model of the same brand and size and although a bit bulkier and heavier still has a great picture without any issues.\n",
      "This is a really nice piece. I purchased it for my Husband whose parents came from Haiti. We have recently merged households and as is typical most of the woman's stuff takes precedence.... This piece has done a great job of bringing his heritage to our home...fits in nicely to our eclectic style and pairs up with some other Haitian art. I do wonder about it authenticity?\n",
      "As soon as the handle is broken,<br />Line is made ​​of plastic fishing line<br />Waste of money I bought them\n",
      "I couldn't have been more lucky to buy this jump start pack when I did. I have a Ford Escape and I just recently (after a series of unfortunate, but fortunate events) found out that my battery needs replaced. I was very thankful that I had this portable jump starter in my trunk to help me get through the day. Not only did I have to use this once, but twice within the same day without any indication that the charge was wearing out. When I finally returned home after the day I wanted to see just how long the charge lasted... so I charged my laptop as well. All of the product details are very accurate. This product saved me from an extremely stressful work day!\n",
      "As a jump starter, the product leaves something to be desired, but once you get it going it will keep on going.\n",
      "The story of this movie is very interesting and attractive. Unfortunately its action is not what I could call ' fast paced'. The actors perform well and they have quite some interesting characters. It' s a nice movie for Sunday evening...but that's all about it.\n",
      "can't say I enjoy this lamp, maybe it wasn't the best option to buy it.... would love to get my bucks spent on this item...\n",
      "Oh wow! This bundle would have been amazing for my son except that it didn't come with the memory card. The PS Vita itself is a very good system, but this bundle is a bust. This bundle would be a lot better if it came with a better game.\n",
      "Not impressed with the quality of this mount. It is not sturdy and my roku did not fit on it properly. i have the Roku 3 but still no good.\n",
      "When we got this cash register, we had hoped it would help our kids learn their money. Sadly, that wasn't the case. The money looked generic and it didn't teach them anything. We ended up sending it back for a different one.\n",
      "I like the concept that the show and game combination represent.  It give an opportunity to for constant refreshment of the game. The play control is also intuitive and robust and game play is engaging.\n",
      "Good concept for a lock but it seems that it still have things to upgrade with it. Sometimes it opens and sometimes not.\n",
      "There were too many gaps in the dvd and I don't think this learning kit is thorough enough. Maybe I need to be a little more patient until my daughter gets more familiar with it but it's been more than six weeks now and she's still not getting it or looking like she will in the nearest future. It's a one star from me.\n",
      "It's cheaper than what I expected. These back lights are not good.<br />It's plastic and the clamps for the bike are broke instantly.\n",
      "I love the hat and all the attributes like the color and style. Unfortunately, the \"one size fits all\" doesn't apply to me because when I wear the hat I end up with a headache because it's too small.  Beware fellow big headers; this cap is probably way too tight for you.\n",
      "Apparently this product looks good. The graphic card on my computer has a HDMI port so I thought of buying this product but even a brand new monitor from Dell was not able to recognize it. I don't know if this a compatibility issue or something wrong with the product.\n",
      "This chair is absolutely horrible!!!! Not only is the material fake and cheap but when I unpacked the box and tried to assemble the pieces it jumped up.its not comfortable and isn't at all like advertised... you can get better chairs on amazon on almost half the price! I took the chairs dead body back home and buried it in my backyard. I would NOT recommend this chair to anyone..it's just a real fake...\n",
      "This is a great bundle, my son is handicap and loves to watch movies and have his own stuff in a backpack. This has all the items he needs and he will really like it for his birthday.\n",
      "It is very bright and will display HD and 3D content well. The only reason I took off a star is that the speaker on this thing doesn't deliver the quality sound that you might have expected. Would I recommend it? Yes: the price is very good.\n",
      "I got this as a living room television, hoping it would be decent quality and would last a few years at least. Sadly, that wasn't gonna happen.<br /><br />When using one of the HDMI ports, the picture was very fuzzy and nothing seemed to fix that. Also, the picture quality was worse than the TV I was replacing from 5 years ago! All around I was surprised at the good reviews it got and let alone confused.<br /><br />This was so hard for me, after spending so much money and to be worse off than I was before.<br /><br />After I dealt with returning this TV and researching as much as possible I found a GREAT 50 inch TV that hasn't given me a single issue in any way.<br /><br />If you want to take a look, it is here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/1vi1LHp<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the TV for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one.\n",
      "I already have a really nice expensive air compressor with cables built in so I wanted this to be a backup if for any reason I ran into issues with my model. I took them out of the package when they arrived to play around with them a bit and they are a bit flimsy and somewhat smaller than what I was expecting, but at this price point I'm not all that surprised. In any case, they're sitting in my trunk now in the case that I need to use them one day. Not bad though, glad I got them!\n",
      "Love the color of the luggage. It is what you pay for. The price was cheap, a good thing but the luggage is lacking quality made! However it is nice and will serve my purpose as I don't travel a lot. Good price for 5 pieces of luggage.\n",
      "Poor quality, the button just broke instantly after a month. Just a waste of money, not glad with this.\n",
      "I absolutely love this watch, it's gorgeous! I got many complements on it when I wore it. Only one thing that concerns me is that I wore it all day Sat. and Sun. and when I took it off I did have some type of dark mark on my wrist so I'm hoping this won't happen all the time otherwise it'll make me think it was very cheap.\n",
      "I like the classic look of this watch but more importantly its easy to read at night so it stays functional.  Would like a slightly wider band but it fits nice enough.\n",
      "I really like the graphics on the sports champions' game. Great game to have. I do wish they had more PS move games for age group 10+ for my pre teens. Disappointed in the selection. Once you find a good game it is an excellent system.\n",
      "I like how it has the two side pockets for smaller items, the little bows are a nice touch.. customer service is also great.. takes a little long shipping from china but I did chose the standard shipping, nice size inside of bag too\n",
      "We tried it with our cat, and it might be because the first hole or two were too big, but he refused to use it. He used it before we cut the hole, but refused to use it after we cut the first hole. On top of that, the hole we cut was only half the size of the first hole they have marked on the plastic and it still didn't work. The plastic itself is very flimsey.\n",
      "I have a fairly remote access point for my WiFi. I had purchased this subwoofer kit to set up some active speakers on my balcony. Even though this product is called subwoofer kit, it is actually a full-frequency audio link. After reading the positive reviews I gave it a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately it turns out that no matter where I place either of the wireless units, as soon as the receiver links up with the transmitter, my WiFi is gone. No more access to the AP. Bummer.\n",
      "I washed it following the directions and it does not fit the mattress. It is too small. It also is very puffy and not at all what I would have expected for a sheet. It seems more like a mattress pad, which I already had on the mattress. I was very disappointed. Back to square one.\n",
      "I was disappointed when i received these stickers. The image quality and color is very poor. I mean they kind of work but what's the point if they look bad.\n",

Also, they don't have the factory look, but this can be noticed only when you take a closer and careful look.<br />But, the material from which they are made is a quality one.\n",
      "This seemed to be a legitimate product. But it doesn't actually work. The heat mat doesn't heat anything, and now I'm just going to have to send it back. It's been a huge run-around for me to get the right product for my garden, and now I have to wait for a new one (that doesn't have a defect) to ship out to me.

      "This really can't be used for much more than soldering two wires together. Anything much larger or heavier and it just wants to fall forward especially when you use the magnifying glass. The weight of the glass alone almost makes it tip forward. Although the clip arms are adjustable in about any configuration known to man, that almost makes it worse. With so many possible directions to turn or move the arms, it's hard to tell what part needs tightned to prevent it from slipping.\n",

A few years later and some more experience and I still think it's a great little guitar. I'd advise anyone buying it new now to change out the strings. It has good sound and won't let you down.

Now I'm only glad that it didn't happen on me, this product has some circuit or technical issues, would not recommend!\n",

The maps on this game are so big and yet I still end up spawning with enemies behind me. I will say that it has nice graphics, but even still it lags and graphics aren't the only thing that matter when playing a game. With the maps being as big as they are they should allow a lot more players. We are all hoping that the new one will be better than this one.\n",

      "We purchased this F/X speaker as an option for rear speakers for our living room. The setup was pretty straightforward. The user manual that comes with the speakers is pretty self-explanatory. So that wasn't the problem. Unfortunately, every time someone uses the Internet in our house, the speakers would drop the sound. We tried changing frequency of wireless router but the speakers still don't work reliably. They typically work for less than one minute before dropping the audio for a few seconds. This is really annoying. I had some high hopes given that the speakers were made by a brand-name manufacturer.\n",

In two lamps that are on/off fixtures, it worked very well, providing even light on the top and bottom of the lamp with no flicker or hum. In the two lamps that have dimmers built in, the bulb flickered and hummed horribly. You could hear it humming throughout the entire room, and the flicker was like a strobe light. Even when the lamp was set to full brightness, the flickering and humming did not stop. I do not recommend these for anything with a dimmer!\n",

      "This watch is uncomfortably huge; it seems to follow the current trend of \"large is stylish\" but it is too large, too heavy, and too uncomfortable for daily wear and use. Having owned and worn a Seiko dive watch for years, I could not comfortably keep this watch (and wear it) so returned it.\n",

      "Awful movie!! Terrible plot or lack there of! Corny fight scenes. I would not ever recommend watching this movie at all, to anyone. I gave it a one star because that was the lowest rating I could put here. If there was any lower rating, it would have given it that. Horrible!\n",
      "I am a daily commuter so I always bring an umbrella with me. The weather is just ridiculously unpredictable! This one works for me.

      "I went ahead a got this TV for my bedroom and expected a quality TV even though it was priced so great. I was excited, but that didn't last very long...<br /><br />The resolution was sub-par, but the sound was absolutely horrible. My phone speaker sounds better than this TV did. I tried to deal with it and get used to it but I just couldn't!<br /><br />I did my research, which I should have done the first time and settled on something I was a little more confident with.<br /><br />So glad I found a better TV, I have never been happier with it and I expect that to continue after having it for just over a month now.<br /><br />If you want to be sure you're getting a quality TV check out this one on Amazon -------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nF1tHE<br /><br />If you decide you want to go another route, I'm glad I could be of some help with this one!\n",
      "I got this camera hoping to get something I wouldn't have to upgrade for years. I had tons of plans for it and couldn't wait to get it and start using it. Sadly, I wasn't able to do what I wanted and expected with it due to two main issues. First, just about 9 out of 10 shots I took, the pictures didn't focus correctly. I thought I was doing something wrong but come to find out, many people have had this same issue when I researched it online. Also, during use the camera would randomly turn off without any warning what so ever.<br /><br />After dealing with the issues I had enough and did some research to find a camera I knew I wouldn't have an issue with. Luckily, I found a great camera that I absolutely love. Every picture comes out nearly perfect and I love the way the interface is set up, much more user friendly. I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over month of using it as much as possible.<br /><br />If you want a great camera that you can count on, get the same one I did here on Amazon --------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1oapQK7<br /><br />I hope I'm able to keep others from making the same mistake I did and get the better camera in the first place!\n",
      "I jumped the gun on this 4K TV, yes, the picture is pretty, yes, its got a fancy look to it, but when it all boils down to it, its just a “higher\" definition TV that you barely notice a difference after a while, I bought mine in Best Buy and side by side you can see the difference when compared to a 1080P set, but once home and set up, its meh.<br />For the price I paid I could have bought 3 1080P LEDs TVs but had to have the new stuff first. I halt from giving it 5 stars due to the price and what it really is capable of so far, in terms of 4K content, which for the time being, is pretty much non existant, but hey, I got bragging rights!\n",
      "It has a great picture that you can tweak to match your preference. I was really surprised that it has such a great sound quality to it as well, with different EQ options. The price was very good for the quality of the picture and the custom options.\n",

      "Zoom H1 is a great recorder. It does the job great. I was looking for alternative like this because Zoom H4n is very pricey. I've been using it for documentary videos and it really captures rich quality sound. It's worth the $99!\n",
      "Completely disappointed with this product. Returned the first one, because (I thought) it was damaged. When the replacement came in, it was just as bad. Apparently what I thought was damage, was just the poor quality of this product. Would not recommend anyone to purchase this.\n",
      "This watch is beautiful and I loved it on first sight. However, I got the white and the hands do not show up to where you can easily read the time. I constantly had to turn the watch at an angle so I could see the hands. Just too annoying to keep the watch. I sadly had to send it back. The other colors may not have this problem.\n",
      "First of all, the tote is very large and more suitable for travel. I read the dimensions, but was still surprised by its size. The bag is very well made with lots of extras. Will use this as a gift for friend that has a small business and can carry her samples in this tote.\n",

      "Great 5-Star Product but An Obvious knock-off of the Original McPolo's BabySoft Bib<br /><br />This brave seller doesn't seem to care if he is violating any copyrights or infringing on any trademark and patent protections. He is not even weary about offering a knock-off product of the highly acclaimed McPolo's BabySoft Bib, a quality product at Amazon most parents are aware of. Not only that, he just casually \"drives through all the red lights\" so to speak and \"borrows\" their product images puts on his own logo and calls them his own! Sorry it is what it is, this is stealing under broad daylight! More to that, the language he uses to describe the product is also just too obvious a copy from the originator's version, as if he does not have any imagination, enthusiasm or beliefs pushing his knock-off product, but just wants sales, sales and more sales. One more thing that I cannot swallow, and it is the final nail to the coffin: He even brave enough to \"borrows\" McPolo's customers' product reviews next door on Amazon, word-for-word and fabricates the entire customer reviews entries!! I give him a 5-star for his guts!! But I cannot stomach and condone blatant business misconduct in such a way under Amazon's nose. I wonder why they don't take actions against this seller, to be honest. Sorry, I will not buy this product at any price. Fair competition is ok, but this is just too much, too much in-your-face, unethical and it is totally un-American.\n",

Something is very, very wrong here. I've ordered ink cartridges before and I have never had one dry out so quick. I've requested a refund and he won't give me my money back.

      "A failure overall. I put it to use in a 300 square foot room and it ran it for over 6 hours with no much cooling. I also had to drain it after three days of use. This was not really what I was hoping for. Connecting the hose to the window setup was also a huge annoyance.\n",

The band is good looking but very stiff, lucky i got a Russian mechanical watch with a good band but always runs fast, and that was the reason for buying this one. Also when I got it, it didn't move after i wound it up so i thought it was broken. But when it fell on the ground and i tapped it, started moving. All in all, it has a great look just a little thick(more then a cm)\n",

I thought the trap was finally working, but when I revisited the trap 15 minutes later, they were gone. The trap was again antless.<br /><br />These &#34;traps&#34; are great at attracting ants, but they have a fatal flaw--they can't keep the ants from escaping.<br /><br />Either Pennsylvania has super strong mutant ants, or these are just poorly designed traps.\n",
      "Nice headphones. They have a full sound and are good for recreational listening. If you are seeking true professional headphones and have the money you may want to look elsewhere. But overall, great quality from Sony for the price.\n",
      "Can buy locally for cheaper.  Doesnt really pick much up.  Used a few times, but will not keep using, just does not do the job.\n",
      "So where's the sound? This is definitely long and the first time I used it the sound was actually top notch but now there's nothing! What the heck?\n",
      "Even though they do seem smaller these would good stickers if they actually stayed on! For that reason, these are worthless! Well, unless you need colored paper dots.\n",
      "This watch just plain sucks. Its not about functionality, I guess it was all about art deco. Hard to set and read the time.\n",
      "This is not a mask for any serious divers. I used this mask and on the FIRST DIVE!!! the damn cheap rubber strap broke on me!; when I was at my safety stop and clearing my mask. For $80 dollars you would think they could use a quality strap with maybe some neopreme on the back?<br /><br />This is what I had to end up doing and after that the mask does function as stated so that is why I am giving it two stars\n",
      "This is such a fussy apparatus. If you want to drive yourself crazy trying to make this work every time you use it--only to have it fall right back down, go for it. Otherwise, spend $20 more bucks and get a good gate. This one went straight back.\n",
      "I had ordered a King size Fiber bed but the one which is shipped to me is of size queen. Also the Fiber bed is too soft and uneven. I would not recommend any one to buy this and waste money.\n",
      "I previously have had great luck with this brand , owned 2 prior to this one, BUT THIS ONE WAS GARBAGE...  It did not last 1 outing and poles twisted at top where holes punched for snap clips to lock in( same gauge material used on 10 x 10 canopies poles, it should be thicker on 12 x 12). I Will not purchase this brand until serious changes made in construction.\n",
      "It seems like over time it could possibly tear around the bottom edges on the top screen side, it just seems a little flimsy, but it's been great so far. My only complaint is that the top edge is exposed just simply because it couldn't be all enclosed and still able to open and close.\n",
      "I rate this 4 stars, for 200 bucks, you get what you pay for, you wont get theatre sound, but the sound is not tinny either. Good bang for the buck if you have no option for real surround sound.\n",
      "I own 2 Britax Frontiers in Pink, and the Graco Nautilus in pink as well.  My friend has one of these: http://www.amazon.vote/Graco-Nautilus-Car-Seat-Matrixgp/product/B0011URFRE/  As a Mother who owns both models, I will tell you the major differences between these two seats from my point of view. #1 Frontier is more expensive which is why I got the Nautilus.\n",
      "What I really don't like about this is that the parts are too small that even I would be having a difficult time putting them together, how much more my little nephew. Such a waste.\n",
      "These were difficult to keep on our small dog and we had to get another diaper to go on top of it. They worked fine with the second cloth diaper.\n",
      "The package arrives tightly rolled which seems good for getting into the cab over camper but beware it cannot be returned if opened (kind of like those mystery boxes as a child \"you get what you get\") The instructions said that it would take 2-3 days to expand to the full 6 inches of thickness but 2weeks later it still sits at about 3 very firm/ compacted inches.\n",
      "This camera takes very poor quality photos. If you are going to spend the money get a more reliable name.\n",
      "This duffle bag is too small. I love the look of it but when I used it, I was not able to get everything in it and I was just packing a few things for overnight. I think that it should be made a little larger.\n",
      "This bag does all it is designed to do. It holds my 15 inch notebook and all the accessories. It is easy to carry because of the straps, stands up by itself, nice. It is a little heavy to lift initially but I carry it on my shoulder with the bag leaning on my back and it's a breeze.\n",
      "Doesn't give off the nice, full sound that i would have wanted for a speaker. it's not even cheap and yet it cant perform as expected.\n",
      "Watch is gorgeous, but has no way to make wristband bigger so if you have big wrists or don't like your watch tight you can't adjust it. Also it needs black hands so it's easier to read.\n",
      "This product doesn't last very long especially for a guy of my large frame. The mat just got cracked and chipped and it was rather hard to unroll for a few days.\n",
      "Although I bought this luggage for my daughter for a holiday gift, it appeared to be very attractive and of good quality. I don't think she has had the opportunity to use it yet, but will be very soon, so I cannot comment on the quality after being handled by the airlines.\n",
      "At first, I absolutely loved this machine! That changed quickly. It only worked for a few hours before it stopped working. No sound came out, and it didn't matter how many times I replaced the battery. Frustrated and sending this back.\n",
      "I like the bag-have found Travel on to hold up very well. The color is as advertised. I was not as happy with this bag because one of the sides does not zip down on both sides far enough... So is more difficult to access.\n",
      "I seem to be on the go a lot so this helps keep me sane. The screen is a little tiny an it doesnt feel like quality for the price.\n",
      "The hand-grip on the thing is very uncomfortable and it quickly becomes painful on the joints of my hand. The tool got broken for how many weeks only. It didn't last for a month. Disappointed.\n",
      "I wish this thing had a more refined user experience but other than that it's awesome. It's nothing like the Boxee or Apple TV, even as much as it looks like one. It loads right into the android desktop. If you've ever used an Android tablet then you're right at home. I've got mine plugged into the Ethernet. Plugged it in and it got an IP address and off to play without any problems. Takes a little getting used to if you've never used Android before. Lots of resources on the internet. Great forum on their support site. Customer support is AMAZING. They answered a ton of questions before and after I purchased it. I feel confident in buying it. It's a little glitchy here and there but I think they'll have this perfected with software updates in no time.\n",
      "Had to send it back because after I loaded my music onto it, it would not play. I like the brand because I had one before and it was great and played great, will have to reorder, since I have paid for this one I sent back, hoping the company will send me another one.\n",
      "the leather is extremely odorous. Left it in my room for a day, came back, and the whole room smelled like the bag. I personally can't stand the smell. Zippers are very cheap\n",
      "I use this with Dragon, picks up stray sounds so must use in quiet environment. Probably better desktop microphones available but got this on sale at great price. Accuracy 99% in quiet room. Keyboard noise is picked up and occasionally interferes with recognition.\n",
      "It tipped over so easily. It was really disappointing because I expected so much from this<br />product.\n",
      "Bought these for my surefire flashlight. Took weeks to get in the mail and most importantly when i put them in my flashlight they blew the b\n",
      "TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!! for the cheap price, I guess I shouldn't have expected much. This mp3 player does not even REGISTER on any computer. I have plugged this thing into several computers, old and new, updated Windows and MAC/APPLE computers and it does NOT let me load any music on it. It just plugs in and says &#34;USB device ready to use&#34; but it doesn't even let me find the drive on the computer to load any files on it. I want my money back for this knockoff.\n",
      "I am not a TV/nor technical person; so, I really cannot give a decent review. I ordered this to be used as a PC monitor. And it serves that purpose beautifully. When I stream movies they came in sharp and clear.\n",
      "The leather quality is very good. However, the disappointment was about the following. The design of this bag appeared to be inconvenient for usage. The zippers are placed the way you struggle opening and closing them. You barely are able to use the zippered pockets which start at one side, and end at another.\n",
      "I purchased the first edition Octomask and was quite pleased with the performance of the mask. However the design I was not a big fan of. So when I saw this product I decided what the hell; same company and much nicer look.<br />That was a BIG MISTAKE.<br />This mask leak water slowly through the two side (until you get to about under 20 feet were the pressure pushes enough on it to make it stop leaking) On top of this I emailed the owner after he told me to and then ended up on a MAILING LIST! I got Octomask mail now 1 sometimes 2 times a week. Thank God for the Spam Filter.<br />I am going to be sticking with the original for now and making sure never to give my email out again to another amazon merchant.\n",
      "Title says it all... You can do much better as far as sound quality for far less money. They have decent bass, stylish looks, fair build quality, but simply are not the headphones for serious listeners.<br />They performed pretty good on hip-hop, but if you are into anything else, and expect $200 worth of sound, these fall way short. In fact for half the money, you can get a set of Sennheisers that out perform these hands down.<br />In my opinion they are simply a name brand fashion accessory and not a performance headphone. Guess it boils down to:<br /><br />Are you looking for great sounding headphones? - these are not it. They get points for style, and bass performance is solid.<br />Mids and upper frequencies are muddy and lack luster. They simply fall flat for most music.<br /><br />Are you looking for a fashion accessory and don't really care much for sound over looks and branding? These are your headphones. They do look nice, are fairly comfortable for semi-long wear. They have a solid ( but boomy ) bass response, but really.... At $200, they are just over priced bling.<br /><br />To each their own, I think if people were honest, they couldn't possibly justify the price to performance, had they actually listened to some good headphones. Or perhaps they just need to attempt a justification for spending $200 on these, but bottom line is: if you want performance, sound quality, build quality, and maybey not so much the looks and the branding. You can do much much better in a set of Grados or Sennheisers. If you just want ridiculous bass you can get the Klipsch for $50 less and they sound just as good, if not better. I can't tell ya what you like, but I know good sound... And you may have noticed I didn't mention several other over priced branded headphones that I seen others mention. Basically for all the same reasons... You can do a lot better for a lot less money. But even if you decided to buy a $200-$300 set of Grados or Sennheisers, you are gonna get what you paid for, and they will completely destroy the branded price equivalent.<br /><br />That's my opinion : )\n",
      "metal frame bends pretty easily, it was a total waste of money to me.  you'd be better off flushing your dollars down the drain or lighting them on fire for all the good these super cheap glasses will do.<br /><br />I bought a pair of gunnars and they seem to be working out great, if you can pony up the extra cash.  here's the pair I bought:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/INT-00101-Intercept-Advanced-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B00CAUTK0E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1413500438&sr=8-1&keywords=gunnar+intercept\n",
      "Don't buy these!!!!!! This is a horrible company with horrible customer service. I ordered a product from them and never received it and they actually refused to refund me any money. On top of that they were rude and threatening. I honestly don't know how they've managed to be in business as long as they have. Crazy Crayons gives eco-products a horrible name. I would rather just order conventional crayons that be defrauded out of money.\n",
      "The description doesn't match the product (doesn't that always seem to happen?). I ordered this over a month ago and I JUST got it in the mail. Not to mention it's only 85 inches long when it was advertised 103 inches. I got it and it doesn't even fit my bike. And now I'm going to have to buy another one. What a waste of $30.\n",
      "This watch was gifted to me. It's an awesome buy for professional and occasional wear. The pearl dial reflects rainbow colours and adds to the beauty. The steel strap and body with the round dial is simply perfect.\n",
      "If you have this dvd and don't know what to do with it, flush it down the toilet. That is still being nice to such a load of crap.\n",
      "I am so sorry to have to leave a less than favorable review of this product, because I'm sure it's good for cats, especially older cats like mine, but my guy just won't eat this. He just doesn't like it. Perhaps if they come out with some different flavors.\n",
      "I haven't had this for a long time yet, but it is very light and the quality is good. The inside divider is good for separating clothes. I like the appearance of this.\n",
      "The skip hop looks great but the quality is lacking. Only after a few months of use, the changer began to unravel at the seams. When I emailed customer service about this I got no response. Then I posted a comment to their facebook page, and they deleted it! I am pretty disappointed that a company like skip hop wont stand behind their products. Won't buy from them again.\n",
      "I bought this pellets for my bunny. She sometimes nibbles and plays with it. I found that she likes it and enjoying eating it. However, im very allergic to the dust this pellets have. When my rabbit chews, fine powder is all over the floor. When I clean it, I had to sneeze and itch all over day.\n",
      "I thought this would be a good game but I was terribly wrong. Don't waste our money on this game, It doesn't work!!\n",

      "This TV show aired the 1st 3 seasons.  The 4th season was filmed, but never aired on TV.  I'm going to sit on the sidelines & wait until this is done RIGHT, meaning all 4 seasons + some EXTRAS become available as a SET  I didn't know about this show until the beginning of the 3rd season, which means I've never seen the 1st 2 seasons.  A \"season\" consisted of only 13 episodes.  I'm unwilling to buy this piece meal.....meaning 1 season at a time.  I'm hoping others will express similar sentiments & encourage the studios to do this RIGHT -- meaning a set of all 4 seasons + EXTRAS\n",
      "Does exactly what it's meant to do. Only, just be careful how you insert VHS tapes. If you do not insert the VHS tape straight or slowly it will damage the tape. We use this item everyday. So far so good.\n",
      "Not a good substitute for a window unit and definitely not a good replacement from central. With the weak cooling output, I'm surprised this is anything more than a 9K or 10K btu, it simply does not cool a room even after 12 hours of operation. It also fills up with condensation fast, be prepared to empty every 4-5 hours or it will completely stop cooling. The window kit that comes with this is a disaster. It takes a lot of effort and duct tape to keep it fixed. I wonder how many people have wasted hours installing this unit. A very poor excuse for an air conditioner. \"\n",
      "these are printed red, but not fluorescent making them really hard to see at a distance (which is why I ordered these). Will look for a better option in the future.\n",
      "Doing good, got it as a replacement for my old player, guess I wore that one out.  Have had audio drop out which is annoying and keeping it from a five star review.\n",
      "It does everything it says it can do, works well with .mkv files (720p, 1080p), XBMC works great, I plugged in my own keyboard and mouse and it works. I would recommend this box to anyone.\n",
      "These black crew sox are very poor. They are paper thin, and will probably not last many<br />months. The fit is poor, the elastic does not hold them up, and so all day I'm cinching them back up which is incredibly irritating. The only good thing I can say is that they are cheap.\n",
      "Are you serious? I thought I'd be getting more than this for a start since I was planning on giving them to some of my friends. For some weird reason, I thought it was cute, morbid inference notwithstanding.\n",
      "This product only has its look working for it as it isn’t really doing anything as a fan. I can barely feel the air that it is supposed to be blowing. So I just gave this to my daughter as a novelty item in her room. At least it served some kind of purpose.\n",
      "This rusts so fast I barely got it wet before it disintegrated into red powder. That's a joke, except for the rusting part. It really is fast.\n",
      "Prompt delivery.. not too bad for the money. The reverb on the amp does not work. Tuning is difficult needs adjustment from octave to octave.\n",
      "Makes my DVD's look good on the HD TV.  If you are just looking for something to play DVD's this is a good choice.\n",
      "When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, take a look at this one here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/181sLOx<br /><br />I have never been happier with any other headset and hope you get the same result if you decide to try one!<br /><br />If not, at least I got to share my experience with this headset!\n",
      "This is light weight and easy to use. It is not child sturdy so I would not let them play with it. I have not used it in the car yet. Nice carry case and easy instructions.\n",
      "I bought this tote for a light weight travel bag for carry-on. I have it all packed (holds quite a bit, not overdone with inside compartments) and ready to leave for trip to LA, then Kauai. We'll have to see how it holds up.\n",

      "WARNING !!!  These floor mats are no where near heavy duty, they are paper thin I would say about as thin as a credit card, they literaly started to crumble and brake  apart as if was old cake within a months time, My car is paked in a garage so its not so hot in the car I cant imagine why it would fall apart other then the item is garbage,  the comapany said it was a defective product they sent me another one and a month later the exact same thing happened.\n",
      "There are so many negative reviews, and now I understand why. At first, it seemed light, easy-to-use, and a decent product. Then it kept getting wrapped around the shaft. I tried everything, but no matter what I did, I couldn't get it to work again. So I just gave it up and tossed it in the garbage. Everyone says you get what you put in. You get what you pay for. But I feel like this was genuinely a rip-off, regardless of price. If I pay $15 for something, I shouldn't be expected to throw it out.\n",

      "This piece is very low quality and very difficult to put together. It's not sturdy, and had to buy extra screw to keep it nice and tight. It took several hours to put together, didn't even finish it in one sitting and am pretty damn good with my hands. I am disappointed with this piece and do not recommends it.\n",
      "Way, way too loud. I don't even understand why this makes this much noise. I actually have to cut the gas down by about half in order for the sound to be bearable. I'm definitely getting something else, and I'll be returning this as soon as possible.\n",
      "This wallet is made up of very poor quality materials. I got mine a week ago and now the leather designs are peeling. I don't recommend this product.\n",
      "Dear GOD. Save me from ever having to use this again.<br /><br />This thing is only good for turning up recently laid potting soil.<br /><br />It will not till any soil that has not been previously tilled.<br /><br />It is AWFUL!\n",
      "Keeps me secure from the sun or rain. Could have given this a perfect score but because folding and unfolding the umbrella takes a while, I had to make the necessary adjustments.\n",
      "I usually travel stand-by and have to pack as efficiently as possible for a trip that can be 2 days or 14 in one small bag. I love everything about the bag except.. the interior space is awkward due to the design of the handle.\n",
      "It's a good can but the cover does not fit and is very tight. I had too bend it a little so that the cover can fit.\n",
      "I bought this product with high expectations since it had a lot a positive reviews. I will have to say I am dissapointed. I have used this product for only a month and and it doesn't hold air like it used to when it was new. I guess the the quality of material used is inferior or there is a flaw in the design.\n",
      "I bought this bag, and when I started using it few things came before me! The color was good at the start  and later it started wearing off, and after 5 months of use I cannot use it anymore.\n",
      "For the price, this was one of the best watches that I have ever purchased. The solar charged battery has never dropped below fully charged and the time has remained right on the money.\n",
      "nice watch, medium quality made but ok, nice and works well , my girl wants one to now, must buy one more.. for now\n",
      "There was absolutely nothing different when this product was used and I don't expect many other customers to experience otherwise.\n",
      "Got this for my sister so she would keep her coca cola sticky hands off my expensive keyboard. The sound is surprising good. You can't beat the price for what the keyboard will do. I thought I would have to set it up for her but this is essentially out of the box ready to go. The headphones are acceptable but you'd do better to get a decent pair if you want quality sound. If you're just starting out, not sure if you are serious about playing, or just want something to plunk around on, this is a great option.\n",
      "I purchased this TV last month as a bedroom TV. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 32 inch TV, check this one out here on Amazon ---------> http://amzn.to/1oUQx9X<br /><br />I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!\n",

      "horrible, they tore off just taking them out of their original packing, the bottom part of the sticker is kind of difficult to stick probably because its too small and it tore off easily.\n",

      "I bought two of these purses in different colors and the totes to match. They were supposed to be presents for my mother and sister for mother's day. The purses were small and cheaply made and the totes were even smaller! I don't know how they could even be called totes. Super disappointed.\n",
      "After watching the rest, I can say this is the worst of the bunch. Not that they are great movies, but they are fun, unlike this one.\n",
      "Cheap materials, such a disappointment for the price. Very poor in quality and it wont even stand still.\n",

      "You can't beat 8 dollars for 60 picks.<br />The picks are good and coming in different thickness helps to be versatile. It's not D'Andrea but my playing is not influenced just by the pick. Really good deal for the price. but i rather use a different brand.\n",

      "Terrible. A break lead while sharpening and chews down the whole pencil before creating a sharp point. Seems to be askew and at a slight angle. Also the angle it sharpens at is very acute, makes for a weird tip shape.\n",
      "When I decided to go back to school and get another major I decided to look for a new backpack. I love the color and it has a lot of compartments or pockets inside that you can put inside it with different things you need. Since I am going back to school I do have a lot of things I needed to pug around in it. I also like the straps because it is very sturdy and it does not feel like cutting into my shoulders. I like the way it hanging on my shoulders, it is very comfortable. To sum it up, I love it because it holds everything that I need and it is also surprisingly comfortable and really appears beautiful and durable. I highly recommend to all the students.\n",
      "Total junk. Used once and threw it away. It does not pump at all anymore. Save your money and don't buy this cheap product.\n",
      "There really isn’t much about this product to complain about since it works in as much as it supports my neck. I just wish that it was bigger though.\n",
      "I was hoping that this product would not end up as reviewed, but it certainly does rust. I don't understand how that happens as I keep it away from anything wet and make sure that it's always on a dry place. But still, it rusts.\n",

It ripped within literally 1 day of normal use.<br />My 15 month daughter only put her dolls inside that weigh less than 2 lbs... so I'm really not sure how and why that happened, I guess it was poorly stitched.<br />The wheels are also very flimsy and aren't alined  well, making 1 of the wheels useless. Its like dragging the floor instead of wheeling.<br />I really am not impressed & quite disappointed with it.\n",

      "It's cheap but I don't think I will buy this again. The paper is so very thin. It works for printing personal stuff, but not for business use.\n",
      "Its a good watch. When i am wearing it a lot of people actually do notice the watch. I made the right choice when shopping online. Good price. You can compare it with the other brand names with its quality. I will recommend it to my friends. Thank you amazon for this opportunity to buy a cheaper but quality product!\n",
      "Misleading product. I was so existed to find a Bugaboo doll stroller but when I contacted Bugaboo they made it very clear to me that this Is not a stroller made by them and this stroller is just a cheap knock off. DO NOT BUY.\n",

      "I bought this suitcase a little over 6 months ago. The first trip went fine, but after the second the stitching started to come out form the front pockets and one of the wheels broke off. This seems to happen often with this design.\n",
      "At the price I got this, I surely can't complain. It offers great value for your money. I had doubt in the size of the speakers right from the picture but I made the gamble anyway. They sure are small but the sound is great and amazing. looks like a lie that it comes from those speakers. Totally awesome.\n",
      "It said Blu-ray player so I got it to play my Blu-ray discs. As far as I know, it did exactly that, and I have absolutely no complaints about it. That's my opinion anyway.\n",
      "My assistant ordered this and placed it in my office. When I saw it, I immediately concluded that it was too fragile to hold anything heavier than a feather. I was right too since my colleague got one too and it collapsed after he put documents and vases with water and flowers on top of it.\n",
      "I bought the camera to take still photos of scenery when I'm out hiking & or geo caching.  I wanted the 18mm wide angle lens.  I didn't realize until after getting it that I'm unable to add a 5-10 second audio recording when taking stills.    I was planning to buy an AC power adaptor but didn't like the \"fake\" battery mickey mouse arrangement.  The camera should have a receptacle so the AC power cord can plug directly into the camera.  I never took the camera out of the box & am returning it.  It simply doesn't have a very basic feature that I'd assumed was part of the camera.\n",

      "I had ordered it thinking it was going to be the illusion cube (white body and black stickers) as shown in the picture but I just got a all black one. It was still the 56.4mm size that was advertised, but I didn't revive what was shown in the picture. I am still satisfied with the cube, but I didn't get what I ordered.\n",

      "For the price these are not bad, and don't get me wrong they work great. The only problem that i had is that the parts that go around your ear don't go completely around, they kind of sit on top of your ears and are a little bit tight. The plastic isn't very giving so it makes them a little tight around your head. Other than that, considering the low price they work well. Although if you are looking for headphones similar to \"turtle beach\" these aren't what you want.\n",

      "The wallet has a great layout for driver's license and cards, but after a couple of weeks the leather began to separate on the ID flap. It looks like it was glued and the frame around the window and stiffened with re-purposed cardboard. This wallet may be OK if you do not keep more than a couple of cards in it at any one time. Like I said, liked the concept, it just failed in the execution.\n",

      "Very disappointed with these bags. I could tell when I opened the box that they looked cheap; more like the ones you see in big box stores. Sure enough, a few tosses in, one of the bag broke. After we decided to play with 3 bags per color, another bag broke! Unfortunately for us, it was the same color! That left 2 bags left of one color and 4 of another. We decided to just quit playing altogether.\n",
      "Getting this was really a case of poor judgment on my part. I should have waited to get a better one which would have lasted longer than the year and a half that this one did. It barely saw any use and yet it just gave up on me.\n",

I like Pokemon so much, but I got this game from my friend last year, this pokemon Art academy doesn't work well on my nintendo.

Please advise.\n",
      "This item was ordered for a family BBQ and arrived in the time required thank to amazons delivery service. Sadly the product was so badly made it was unplayable, as all of the wood blocks were too rough to slide as they weren't sanded at all. the finish just really made this item horrid. I have sent it back for a refund. the Bag looked like one of those free bags that you get your shopping in from the Mall - awful - AVOID\n",
      "I am giving it one star because there is no lower rating. Where in heavens can I start? The first issue with this \"thing\" is that none of the pumps it comes with even fit any of the valves of the raft, I contacted customer service because I thought I just got the wrong pump.\n",
      "Washed them when they first came in, and we thought that we be enough. Except ALL OF THE COLOR came off with it. What if I had put that in my child's mouth? Are you telling me all of the color would have come off then? They're all white now and I tossed them out. It's not worth taking the chance with my baby.\n",
      "This chess set is junk. The seller claims the pieces are \"solid\" and \"filled\", but no - they're each hollow, flimsy and embarrassing. You can blow them over easier than blowing out a birthday candle! The weight of the pieces is about 14 ounces so each piece must be about 1/4 of an ounce. A shabby production all around, as hollow as the claim that these chessmen are in any way standard. By \"value\" I suppose the this means cheesy. Even the board is nasty and smells funny, but we were able to salvage it after we aired it out for a few weeks. Unfortunately you won't be able to do anything about the cheap hollowed out pieces.\n",
      "No plot, no point, no nothing, this has got to be one of the biggest cluster screw ups of a movie of all time. One will lose a few iq points from the opening credits alone.\n",

      "This is the best mic I have ever used. It records beautifully and I'm even writing this with it. It does pick up a little background noise, but that's alright in the long run. For a hundred dollars, this is the way to go.\n",
      "When I first bought this I expected it to be just like my original wireless controllers. While putting it together I noticed it seemed kinda cheaply made. The buttons seem very generic and everything fits together loosely. But then again, it was cheap so you cant really expect much. It functions the way it should and I guess that's all that matters.\n",
      "My daughter is rough on a book bag because she has to put so much stuff in it daily and this one has held together wonderful so far. The color and design was unique so it doesn't get mixed up with other students.\n",
      "This DVD player is fun to have; the ability to bring anywhere, however, the DVD player's battery doesn't last long enough to watch two movies. You'd have to charge it and wait at least 5 hours before you could watch a movie again. If this keeps on I may have to return it.\n",
      "Somewhat disappointed. Smaller than described and face not as shown in photo, but more importantly, looks as though someone dropped paint or splotches of concrete all over the figure. Do not see a way to fix.\n",
      "Terrible, the quality of the leather made it seem like plastic instead of leather and it is already starting to fall apart after two weeks. You're paying for a cheap belt and that's exactly what you get.\n",
      "Beautiful leather, but you can't use it to pack anything more than one night stay anywhere! I go on a lot of weekend trips with my young hockey player... does't work. Kinda useless.\n",
      "It's hard to use, but I can live with that. The range and the unreliable functionality problems though, not so much.\n",
      "I am not sure why they need plastic around the heel, but in any case it's way too tight (I'm a skinny guy too).\n",
      "Just when i got my shipment i tried it out on my pit but he only ate portion of it and he never ate it after that. So i also tried it on my rottweiler and she does not like it also. The only way they would eat it is if i add some caned meat with it then they would, but that shouldn't be the case. so i don't recommend.\n",
      "Should have done some research before buying this model. WiFi I told myself, great! Color touch screen to access all the features, great! I guess it was just a bad model or something, prints well for documents, NOT pictures, oh and the ink? $80 for all 4 cartridges, and if you print a lot in color, you will go through them like water. Oh and the best part. it seems, though connected via WiFi, that 75% of the time, its “offline\" and needs to be rebooted. 2 stars and save your money.\n",
      "I am a huge fan of Steve Madden shoes, I have a million of them and they are all sized about the same but for some reason these are really narrow. I don't have abnormally wide feet, usually \"normal\" shoes are just fine for me, but these are squishing my poor tootsies.\n",
      "Be very careful when you're using this brush! It gets caught on almost everything, especially carpet. Even using it slowly and lightly still pulls out the wool. I'm so upset, and I ended up just throwing it away. That isn't what I wanted to do, and it was a waste of $6, but I didn't know what else to do. I hate it when I buy items that don't even do what they're supposed to do.\n",
      "Junk camera. Quality is poor compared to the options out there. Night mode is unusable if you are planning to see anything 3 feet away.\n",
      "Very Disappointed, This pakage recive by my mother and When he play this DVD its Show 3x Video, Wrong item sent, but my mother fire on me! Dora Mind it\n",
      "Doubt I'll pay to ship it back for repair/replacement. I'll probably just use the USB function and throw it in the trash when that stops working. Not likely to buy from Quality Car Audio again.\n",
      "Very disappointed. The bike was used only moderately but the plastic part broken in about a year for no reason. Looks like<br />bad quality but it's already out of warranty.<br /><br />Not going to but it again. Will try to find something else that fits.\n",
      "Upon receiving the product, the instructions were read and followed for proper installation. When I placed the product on a bathroom tile wall it soon fell off on the floor. Several attempts were made to secure it to the wall but it would not hold the suction and would fall to the floor. The product was returned for a refund at our local store.\n",

      "This cover just barely fits my old keyboard from college days. My old one got tangled up and a cat pooped on it. Well, at least my unit is safe from dirt and dust for now. The material of the cover isn't as good as I hoped as well.\n",
      "I purchased two of these and two of them arrived in a timely manner with more than adequate packaging. I put some Celestion Silver series speakers in there, I found that adding speakers to the cabinets really boosted the performance of them as sound enablers. Only complaint would be the hardware, the screws were too skinny for the speakers I had and the sinks for said screws were screwed on instead of sunk into the wood. Maybe there was a reason for that, I'm not a wood/screw/screw sink guy. I've used them at a couple of shows now and have wound up standing on one of them on more than one occasion because hey rock and roll I'll stay up past 10pm, I don't care. Reasonably priced and functional, plenty of speaker cable in place in addition to an easy install for the speakers (I wound up using the hardware from my old cabinet, though).<br /><br />No gypsy curses detected, so A+ in that category.\n",
      "It's a piece of junk!<br />My son had seen the commercials for what looked like such a fun and exciting new toy.  I was thrilled to find one at Target.  It ended up being such a let down....My son's spirits were as deflated as this stupid balloon.<br />I bought one at Target (for a fraction of the cost that people are asking on Amazon and eBay). I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed. Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable. NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles.  How convenient!  They include a note: &#34;Lifetime replacement warranty&#34; &#34;Do not return to the retailer.&#34; Only problem, they want $7 &#34;handling fee.&#34; Plus the cost of postage to mail it back, which ended up costing me another $5.  So, that was a total of $12 to get a replacement.\n",
      "I received survival tech knife as a birthday gift from my Dad but was pretty disappointed with the product. The knife loaded automatically in my pocket and I almost cut myself. Upon investigating, I noticed the spring is not properly screwed to the knife.. The flashlight is also not working. It seemed like an used item to me. Even it`s given as a gift, I do not recommend it...ruined my birthday. 1 star.\n",

      "I so wanted to enjoy this game, but everything about it screams \"rush hour\" as in you are stuck in your car moving at a snails pace. I have never played a fighting game that is sooooooooo slow. Plus many characters from melee are dumbed down to the point of what is the point in them. Just no, awful sequel to a previous great game.\n",
      "it should have been so much better but you made everything inside the box so cheap. im glad i didnt just hand my girlfriend the box cause it was cheap and why would you put the price on the tag on the necklace like come on. i gotta order a small jewelry gift thing now...\n",

      "I bought this exact Citiblocs set at my local toy store for $25.00 and believe me it is NOT worth more than that. it is NOT smooth at all and my kids got pricks from it. I returned it to my store since it is not a safe  toy for kids to play with.\n",
      "Totally worst my money. I bought the product but i am not happy due to low quality. That's why i am giving 2 star only.\n",
      "Worn out way too wast. Looks like I've been using them for years already. I seen that others had had similar problems. I thought that they would be easily repairable by changing the bearings. I was wrong.\n",
      "Sorry but it wasnt upto my expections. Light wasnt bright enough and just dont like the finishing touch of the product either.\n",
      "I don't want to be super mean, but I feel like I have to express how disappointed I was with this product when it finally came. I put a few pairs of clothes in it, along with some expensive equipment. When I went to pull it out of the car? It all fell out. I mean onto hard cement. My I-pad actually broke, and the warranty just expired. I'm going to have to pass on recommending this to others.\n",
      "First, I went to store after the fact, and realize they were only $$.00. First, the dog was discolored, as if had been sitting there for a while. I didn't want to call and fuss about the dog, didn't even want to go through the hassle. It was for my nephew, if course he didn't know the difference, he's only one, but I did...

      "Giving it 2 stars due to my daughter at one point loving it, what kid doesn't like a tent? But after the exhausting processes of figuring out how it is supposed to set up (directions are horrible) you come to find out that this baby aint coming back down. Why? Is it possible? Yes… if you have absolutely nothing better to do than untwisting all the ties you made up. Trust me, get something that just \"pops up” without the tedious hassle of this thing. Oh, did I mention? Its now a main stay in the corner of her bedroom, just sitting there, on a good side note, its nice to throw her toys in if you have to and make the room look clean should you have to in a rush.\n",

      "Have you ever wished to beat your head against the wall? No? Well just wait until you get half way through this mess, that will be something that seems appealing. EVERYTHING about Die Hard 5 is awful. The acting was phone it in, the dialogue was pathetic and the film was just lousy.\n",
      "Really wanted to like it, cause I think a videogame set in Chicago sounds AWESOME.  Unfortunately, the Chicago in this game is a weird not-really-Chicago.  Like there are mountains in this Chicago.  Among other things.<br /><br />That's a quibble, though, if the game had been super fun to play, I wouldn't have cared.  But so far (and I'm not QUITE finished with it), it's kind of a trudge.  Lot of similar mission types, lot of very loose driving, and a lot of very loose combat.  Loose is a generally good term for the game overall.<br /><br />Since it seems like this'll probably get a sequel one way or another, I'm hoping they can take all the cool fun things out of this one (THE HACKING) and polish them into something really good the next time around.  Worth it at 20-25 bucks tops, probably.\n",
      "She smelled it and just ran off.<br /><br />Maybe it is the smell? or the petroleum like another reviewer stated but I can't give this any more stars.<br /><br />Maybe i'll give it to the neighbors cat and see if she'll eat it\n",
      "This game is/was a gigantic let down. The game is fun the 1st time through.. but after that, it's boring and monotonous. Blizzard clearly showed that they were more focused on creating a Real Money Auction House than a good, enjoyable game.<br /><br />I got this game for the enjoyment of dungeon crawling, but unfortunately, this game doesn't have it. And the itemization is beyond awful. I also purchased this game in anticipation of arena/pvp. But with the induction of the RM-AH, it's essentially just going to be a \"pay2win\" form of pvp.<br /><br />One thing that was particularly painful for me was the fact that when you 1st play the game, you can only play it in Normal difficulty. Beating the game on Normal unlocks the next difficulty, and so on and so forth. This is beyond stupid and was done just to keep people logging time in the game. Normal difficulty is a joke. It's dumb that Blizzard forces you into playing it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a dungeon crawler that's actually focused on \"fun\" and \"gameplay\".. buy Torchlight 2.\n",
      "My dad had this delivered to my doorstep because I complained about my computer desk once. I didn't mean for him to actually buy me one and certainly not this. If you are going to get a computer desk, invest more money and get a truly reliable one.\n",

      "My only complaint with this expensive costume is that people can see your underwear is they are NOT the same exact yellow as the costume. I suspect that the one I got may not be original since it was way below the average selling price, came from overseas, and the seller didn't have strong feedback ratings. Returning it is also painful because I have to cover the shipping back to Japan. I have seem another listing for this product which seems to be better but I don't want to keep expending time-money.\n",
      "The collar works sometimes when the dog barks and sometimes for no reason at all or simply because the dog is scratching. Not an effective product. After 10 days of usage the clip got stuck and we were unable to take the collar off without taking the whole collar apart. You can only put it on another collar if it comes completely apart from the clip, something not mentioned in the product description.\n",

      "This tub is very cute, but I have a lot of trouble getting the plug in. It is especially difficult while holding a squirmy baby, but it is hard even when I have two free hands. Also, perhaps my son is tall for his age, but with the insert he is a bit tall at five months to be able to rinse his hair without worrying about spilling all over the place.\n",
      "I don't know why, but the cushion sagged after just a week of use. My weight is average and I've done nothing but sit on it when watching TV. I'm the only one who uses it too, so I really don't understand how it could have collapsed like this.\n",

      "First, I bought this through digital purchase on the Blizzard website, but I think getting as much negative press out there to prevent more gamers from falling for this ponzi scheme is important.<br /><br />Warning: If you purchase this game, you are willingly becoming a human node to farm profit for Blizzard. The game is designed completely around the need for the real-money auction house to compete and do well in the end-game. The difficulty curve in the final stages of the game is so absurd and the loot system is so obscenely weighted against you in terms of probabilities to actually receive an upgrade, that you have no choice but to farm for hours on end to afford to purchase upgrades from the auction house. This game could have been named: \"The World of Auctions\" and it would have at least not been as big a let down as slapping the Diablo franchise on the front of the box.<br /><br />One month into the game, Blizzard releases the real money auction house. Now the auction house that uses the in-game currency (Gold) is a barren wasteland of good loot. It's meh-mediocre at best. Anything very good to great gets slapped on the Real-money auction house for 25 bucks or more, sometimes 250 bucks. It's ridiculous. But here's where Blizzard's greed starts to shine through. They get $1 for every successful Real-money auction. So there's no incentive for them to fix their broken game experience. They'll just sit back and watch desperate people trying to squeeze an ounce of fun out of their game by spending their real income on virtual garbage. Did a champion pack with aggravating affixes just demolish you repeatedly? Why not spend 5 bucks on this amulet to improve your chances?<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the real-money auction earnings either dump directly into a blizzard balance that you have to spend in their digital store, or you can transfer it through paypal to your account. Paypal takes their cut, and I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard owns some part ofPaypal through subsidiaries.<br /><br />Soon, even the in-game currency will be available for purchase through their real-money auction house. They couldn't figure out how to make a game that the Chinese wouldn't farm and sell virtual goods in, so they just embraced it, and now they're going to get their cut at least.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor, go play something else. This game is nothing but a money grab in a somewhat pretty looking but poorly developed gaming experience.\n",

I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret buying it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming very quickly as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, one of the HDMI ports proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. I tried to deal with it for as long as I could but then decided this wasn't what I paid for.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for much CHEAPER!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 40 inch TV, check this one out here on Amazon -------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qcVVnZ<br /><br />I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here.

      "I can't say that I was impressed by this. I liked the look but when I got to test it out, it couldn't even pass the sitting test. No matter anyone who sat in the chair, they all said it was too slippery and you couldn't actually stay in the chair unless you stressed out your legs. Aside from that, the chair has weak legs and they weren't balanced well. One of them even cracked and I think this is just a cheap chair that looks good, but it's totally not worth the money.

The first thing I didn't like was that there is no leg room. I'm not the tallest person, but I felt like a giant sitting at this desk. After a few weeks it began falling apart piece by piece and the glass started not to fit well and would shift around. Overall I just wasn't happy in any way with it.<br /><br />I dealt with that for a while and then did some research and found a desk that I love now. I fit well sitting at it and it is sturdy as can be.

      "I was sent this and [[ASIN:B00VUHJUDK another solar powered outdoor light]] and neither one managed to last longer than three days. When I first pulled it from its packaging, I was surprised at how small it was, but I decided to follow the directions and get it set up. Then the first evening rolled around and it illuminated my entire front porch, much stronger than another outdoor light I'd been using, and the motion detection worked very well. I was amazed beyond words and I was so thrilled that first night that the next morning, I moved my previous outdoor light and put this one up instead.<br /><br />Day three rolls around and I noticed one evening when I went out that the light didn't work. (The other light died on the second day.) I thought that was odd. Then on the fourth day, I noticed that the light would come on around dusk--not unusual--and the motion detection would work as expected, but a few hours later, dead. For some strange reason, it seems the battery doesn't seem to be holding a charge, which is odd considering I live in Florida, we have no shortage of sunlight here, and this is placed in location that receives direct sunlight for nearly 10+ hours a day. I even tried cleaning off the solar panel, but still no joy. So, yeah, it still works, but only for a few hours each night and by the time it's fully dark out, it's useless.<br /><br />I've since moved my previous outdoor light back and although it's not as bright as this one, it's still going strong all night through.\n",

      "I was really excited about this filter because it looks nearly identical to the Renovo Trio but its a few buck cheaper. Its cheaper because they don't package it properly and because they are selling my contact information and they are using questionable marketing tactics.  First, the packaging; this filter has an activated carbon filter in it. Anyone that knows anything about filtration (air or water) knows that activated carbon MUST BE SEALED. The activated carbon is sensitive enough that it will absorb pollutants in the air and wear out. So, as the filter sits in their warehouse the activated carbon is being used up which means it will have questionable efficacy when you really need it. My filter showed up in a cheap box with a sticker on it. These should be sealed at the factory. I placed mine in a vacuum sealed bag when I got it so hopefully there is still some life left. Being curious as to what I might expect in terms of shelf life, I checked their website and was surprised to find very little technical documentation. It was mostly marketing hype. They apparently haven't done any lab testing to certify the filter in any way. So, I went to Renovo Trio's website to see if they had anything and they had overwhelming amounts of data. I found full testing documentation and some helpful information about the activated carbon filter. According to Renovo (who has done testing), the activated carbon filter is good for 1,000 liters OR 1 year out of its packaging (the Renovo is hermetically sealed). So, if this filter sat in some warehouse for 8 months or so before I received it, then I've got 3-4 months to use it before the activated carbon filter is useless. Don't get me wrong, as a two stage filter, this is pretty good but I paid for a three stage filter and that is what I was expecting.  Second, a week or so after ordering this, I get some telemarketer calling from Survivor Filter trying to get my email and other details so I can end up on some marketing list. I have NEVER had this happen on Amazon and I hope it doesn't become the norm.  So, if you are looking for something that will make you feel like you're prepared (when you really aren't) and you don't care to investigate the validity of a manufacturers claims, buy this! If you would prefer to buy from a company that tests their own products and stands behind their product without selling your name and contact details to a marketing company, then look elsewhere (Sawyer, Renovo, Berkey even Lifestraw).\n",

      "The Wire is one of my favorite shows of all time. I wasn't aware of it when it was still airing on HBO, but after hearing rave reviews I decided to purchase the box set and go from there. As my opening sentence asserts, that was a great decision.<br /><br />Except for the quality of the actual discs. Like others on here have mentioned, this box set is just not up to par. Four of my discs had disc read issues, and one of them managed to completely stop working mid-season. I've since had the entire set replaced, and although the new one works much better, from time to time it still skips or pauses randomly. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what happened during the production run of these as writing DVDs is usually a rather simple process, but something was definitely up.<br /><br />I wouldn't normally recommend this as I'm a firm believer that piracy is wrong, but my suggestion would be to buy the set so the cast and crew get their royalties and also downloading a digital copy for pain-free viewing. It's not illegal if you own the product, and honestly it'll save you quite a few headaches. I'm not going to provide you with a link, but let's just say it's not too hard to find if you're so inclined.<br /><br />I don't want to write a mini review on the series as there's many others out there, but I will say that the extra features in this set are fantastic and absolutely worth the price. They really let you delve into the world of Baltimore and see why it's such a terrible self reinforcing cycle. David Simon, despite being a bit of an a**hole, is nothing short of a genius.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review!

I had no problems with the Amazon side of things, and apart from some space issues the install went fine... registering the software was a bit more... problematic as the game gets tagged in Origins, EA, and Bioware social but in my case trying to launch from local shortcuts made me enter e-mail/pw for my online account then the reg code then telling me congrads w/big green play button which goes to we're sorry can't connect and that's it. For a week. Nothing. Yelled help and gave it a little time. Nada. So, after a week with no love from ea I tried something else and in literally 15min I was FINALLY able to boot the bloody thing... which I currently hold such a bad taste in my mouth over I'm gonna set her aside for now and give it a spin when I'm not so strungout over the effort to run the thing than all anticipation has turned to meh... will update when I can more fairly access gameplay.<br /><br />...<br /><br />So I start as a fantasy race female character who quickly ends up in a prima nocta situation from the human nobles, captured via cut scene, and fighting her way out of the dungeons with her cousin. This was immensely satisfying as the humans actions in slaughtering helpless companions left zero moral question to the violence and your party's toons are quickly splattered in the gore of your fallen human foes... HECK YEAH! They got their hook in me... and promptly forgot to set it as the immediate next \"interaction\" has the authorities come to arrest you and your cousin and the HUMAN there to recruit you into the Grey Wardens turns your cousin over taking only you with a stupid argument that your cousin will be safe locked up yet you'd surly be executed if you stay and anyway YOU stepped forward and told the truth (I guess the blood that covered the characters was likely to go unnoticed if I'd just kept quiet) that left me hating the main NPC. There's nothing to express contempt however, you just \"choose\" to cooperate which then results in your going to some town to meet a bunch of HUMANS shortly to be saddled with some silly task to become a Warden that you have to complete with a party of 3 other HUMANS... who you can't kill and who won't leave even when I killed some wounded guy pleading for help in cold blood right in front of them... half the time you have no option in interactions with them but polite ones which prove very frustrating for a character with every reason to hate all humans unconditionally and never, ever work with one. Oops, you can't be that character actually, forgive and forget, it's no big deal, do as your told... it's a story.<br />I don't like that story so I'm putting it down. It's too frustrating. I suppose I'll try a human noble character one day... Maybe the Grey Wardens will start looking like good guys from that perspective as whatever \"story\" is ruining the illusion of freewill that makes play interesting seems more suited to that protag type and the choices that character might make. They miss the range badly for this type with me at least.<br /><br />As far as play mechanics go it's Baldurs Gate spacebar=pause in 3d. it's a pretty thing but it has awkward moments, particularly around pinch-points like doorways, the very points most tactically useful on the maps, really amplifying the fiddly camera. This is easily overlooked in battles your interested in and not easy to overlook in mundane, filler battles where there always seems to be something more to click before the thing will move on.<br /><br />Also, by running a game accelerator that shuts down lots of background processes and setting the exe to compatability for xp sp3, as admin, disable themes, desktop, dpi I get a boot in and exit out that just crashes explorer not winblows altogether\n",
      "This is not the camera bag. Not for the professional camera anyway.<br />And the stench is unbelievable. Had to keep it in garage,\n",
      "I hired an electrician to install this and he could not get it to hang level because of a manufacturer's defect. Can you imagine taking all of those crystals off and wrapping them up to go back to the seller? It wasn't fun at all.\n",
      "It is so stiff it feels like plastic. Doesn't even look like natural leather. It's really frustrating, and it's the second belt I've gotten.\n",
      "Overall I will say this toy has been a fail. No dogs that I have played with have found interest in it. If I throw it like a ball, sure, they will go after it. If you put food in it, yeah they show some interest in it for a while. But i have yet to see a dog play with it on its own time.\n",
      "Wonderful product, when you can get it to work. After seven uses, it just burned right out. Naturally, I called them and they told me they couldn’t help me. Excuse me. Customer service CAN’T help me? Apparently they don’t make the part that it needs anymore. If you’re still selling the product, you should be selling all of the parts that it needs until you run out. Just my expert opinion.\n",
      "I tried to give it a chance, but it just didn't work out. The sound was awful when I record it, no matter how much I tune it. I even bought software just for this violin and I still didn't get what I wanted. It's partly my fault since I was being too cheap. If you want a good instrument, you will inevitably need to dish out a little more.\n",
      "DON'T BUY THIS,IT's A WORTHLESS camera with ugly audio and video resolution...Just don't waste money on this,or you will regret it just like how i do\n",
      "I purchased this TV last month as a bedroom TV. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for $100 CHEAPER!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 40 inch TV, check this one out -----&#62; http://amzn.to/SCb3Qp it is here on Amazon. I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!\n",
      "I am overall pleased with the unit however it is nearly impossible to use without using the remote. Something as simple as pushing the \"play button\" on the actual unit and it doesn't play the Blu-Ray.\n",
      "This was not the product I was expecting or advertised here. The colors are off, quality is very low and size is tight so it won't fit an average 5'8 person. Stay away from this counterfeit crap made in Hong Kong.\n",

      "I am fascinated by the new Pope Francis and I have purchased every book and video I can find on him. I think he is a truly inspirational figure and that he will transform the Catholic Church. I think this is a good bibliography on his life, but I think the other videos on Amazon are better, more comprehensive and portray a more human figure. This DVD feels like a bunch of news interviews strung together. Its informative, but doesn't capture who the man Pope Francis really is.\n",
      "You get what you pay for on this one. yes it is a cheap option but it is not a quality option. I would spring for a better name.\n",
      "I returned this grill. It had sharp edges which may injure the owner. Also the grates were not removable, so it would be very difficult to clean them. We were quite disappointed with the grill. It didn't put out enough heat to cook a steak. I guess you got what you paid for in this case..\n",
      "Love the design, hate the bag itself. It’s tiny, gets damp so easily, and doesn’t hold any odors in. I’m not trusting this company again. I can’t believe my bathroom floor was literally dripping with the stuff coming out of this. Ugh.\n",

      "After weeks of browsing and going back and forth between other products, deciding which infrared space heater to get in this style, I ordered this one and finally received it yesterday. I liked the fact that it has the air purifier AND humidifier built in, I was excited to use it to help lower my gas heating bill. It seemed to have pretty good reviews and I hoped it would work the same for me. But it did not.<br />It did not appear to be defective, it turned on and after a &#34;heat-up&#34; period it started blowing at &#34;full power&#34;. I placed it in a 12x14 room (8 foot ceiling) where my main furnace thermostat is located. The temperature on the furnace thermostat was set at 64 degrees. I wanted to see how much the room temp could be raised with this new heater so the furnace would not kick on. I left the heater running for FIVE HOURS non-stop. The room temperature would not rise over the 64 degrees and the furnace still kicked on even with the heater running. Maybe this one is just a dud, who knows. I have an old small Lasko ceramic heater that outputs more heat than this thing...<br />I have asked for a refund but because I bought from a third party seller (something I usually NEVER do) it will probably be a big hassle if they even agree to a refund and will probably end up costing me more to ship back than the item is worth :(\n",
      "It definitely fits in with the mumblecore movement, even though the posters want you to think it's a real light-hearted comedy affair. So if you're looking for a cool, fun comedy about drinking buddies, that's not quite this.<br /><br />That said, I knew what I was getting into when I watched it, and I still just wasn't that into it.  But again, I think that's because I'm not a big lover of the low-fi mumblecore thing in general.  A lot of meandering scenes, derived from improv.  A lot of really nebulous character moves without much resolution.  It felt like watching people workshop a play, sort of...and you could imagine the play being really good if they thought it out harder, but then they didn't.\n",
      "It is hard to believe that Sony came out with this product. I got the move with my PS3 bundle, I love the PS3 but the move and the camera and games is not a good design. I sold my Move on ebay and am glad it is gone. Do not waste your money, if you like movement games then just get a Wii for that, by the time you buy all the stuff you need for the Move you could buy a whole Wii system!!\n",
      "This desk arrived and the drawer was broken. I didn't send it back because I really didn't care. The desk was being used as a table in a local night club for a party.

      "Obviously, all of us wanted what is Best and affordable if possible but buying online, we always been looking for a company which us good in terms of communication with their customer and especially regarding the warranty of the products like this battery charger. I just saw a review that he is having a hard time claiming his warranty due to a broken product and also his dealing with issues in communicating with the seller. I am not saying he is telling the truth or whatsoever but at least his reviews somehow gives a second thought and look for another seller that is much credible.\n",

      "This is a \"leading brand\" but it didn't help with my dog's fleas at all. I looking it up online, and I found out that this ISN'T the leading brand.

Just go to the store and buy the product, because online ordering is sometimes a mistake.\n",
      "I got this mattress as a replacement to the old one hoping it would work well and be comfortable without spending a fortune. That being said, I just couldn't sleep on this thing. The biggest issue it has is the springs poking through after only sleeping on it for about two weeks. During those two weeks I would wake up with back pain that I had never had before. I tried everything I could to make it work, but I just couldn't do it. I wasn't happy with it and I couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />After doing some research I went with a different mattress here on Amazon and I'm so happy I did. My only complaint is that I should have purchased it in the first place and saved myself time and discomfort. I sleep the best I ever have on it and have recommended it to anyone I know for when they plan on replacing theirs.<br /><br />If you want a quality mattress you'll love, look at the same one I got here on Amazon ----------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1rj0SvF<br /><br />I love the fact that it comes with a 20 year warranty and I hope my experience helps keep others from making the same mistake I did!\n",

      "How is it that 6 customer reviews were written on the same day and all without purchased (see for yourself July 7)? All seem fake. Also the oldest reviews was on July 7, it means this product just launch not long ago and already have 24 reviews, Not sure and not buying.\n",

      "It works till the next rain, or the sprinklers go on or at most about two weeks. I have found the cleanest way to dissolve it is to put some carefully in an empty 2 liters soft drink bottle, add water, and then shake it about. Then let it sit overnight and shake it some more. The problems is that unless you are willing to filter it, it can clog up the little holes in the sprayer nozzle. So using it continuously can be quite frustrating and time consuming. After 2 years, I still have most of my plantskydd remaining. The deer always win!\n",

Wrong treatment. Ok this thing is cool, I'll give it that, but for the love of all that is Holy, the thing just took off on me and crashed in the woods nearby, and when I mean crash, I mean crashed into a few pieces. I was going to buy the Parrot, but heard its limited as far as the Bluetooth will go? And that they have a tendency to do take off only never to return.<br /><br />Thankfully mine was located for a swift back in the box and refund (thank you Prime). Ive seen some really cool videos taken with thing and a lot of people say its great. I think its just a hit or miss, and I missed. Could it have been my fault? Maybe, but I don't remember, plus I thought it had some safety mechanism to prevent this. This impact was so rough I had no access to the crash or I would post it.<br /><br />Great concept, just not there, it's kinda like the ‘flying car'.\n",

The TV worked well for about 2 years, then after the warranty mark (after Samsung wont fix it for free) the TV started to have white dots. These dots increased in number every week, until the screen itself was covered in a tapestry as dense as the night's sky. I sincerely believe this is done on purpose, to force us to buy new TVs.\n",

      "It says black. It's not black. All of the negative reviews say it. I'm so frustrated that I didn't read them and take that advice. That's really the biggest thing. I can't even use it if it isn't the right color. Amazon should do something to check this so we aren't stuck with touch-up paint we can't even use at the end of the day. Worst part? I can't even return it because there isn't a \"legitimate” reason and I should have known what I was buying. Ugh!\n",
      "Received this as a gift, urinal is too small to hold any pee.  If its deeper it will prevent all the splashing.  Returning this for sure.\n",
      "We purchased this for my 26 month old for Christmas. Within a week it was broken. My kids aren't very hard on their toys so I was very disappointed to see it get broken so easily. It was really cute while it lasted, aside from being obnoxiously loud.\n",
      "I wanted to learn how to play the guitar but I didn't want to spend too much on it, so I bought this one. What a mistake that was. The strings broke after the first few times I plucked them. I guess you really can't expect quality unless you spend for it like you mean it.\n",

      "This device did not get any of the readings right even once. I'm inclined to think to things causing this. One is that there is another source of sonic waves coming from the house, distorting the accuracy of the readings. Two is that the device is faulty. Which is more likely?\n",

But, I lost it because it opens many times, it has a weak clasp. My aunt message me and said that hopefully she have to listen the other reviewers, which says that this is not worthy to buy because of this clasp. All we have to do is move on.. All in all this bracelet is not worthy, especially not worth the money!\n",
      "I purchased this TV last month as a living room TV. I saw the great price and decent reviews online and decided to take a risk and purchase a TV that had mixed reviews... Boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for only $80 more. Trust me, $80 extra is worth the better quality TV and not having to deal with a bad quality TV and returning that bad TV.<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 40 inch TV, check this one out -----&#62; http://amzn.to/SCb3Qp it is here on Amazon. I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!\n",

      "This was purchased for my daughters wedding. The cord to take it down the aisle was caught and my son had to bend down and roll it out by hand.

      "I ordered these for my garage door opener.  Price is great, and so are the reviews so I am thinking I got a bad batch because its been literally two weeks since I installed them into my two garage door openers and already both of them, at the same time, stopped working.\n",

Will be returning item.\n",

      "The game represents a tremendous amount of effort and investment and, for those impressed by such things, Resident Evil 6 may delight. But all the effort in the world won't make up for a lack of vision. This game is blind to imagination and focus. Capcom's uncertainty about the series' identity post-Mikami (and post-Uncharted) is hardcoded into its structure: four campaigns offering different, flawed expressions of that potential. And the inevitable price for this wavering is a lack of coherence. Resident Evil 6 is an unwieldy tribute to the series' past, an uneven expression of its present and an unwelcome indication of its future.\n",
      "There was a slight dent in the top of the unit, however I believe the power up failure was not caused by the small dent from shipping. The product did not work at all stay away from it at all costs.\n",

      "Forskolin provided me with a lot of extra energy that was very useful in my line of work as an editor for an online magazine. I can stay for longer hours in the office and deadlines are met easily. It stopped me from gaining weight, too. I still personally cover a lot of events and wining and dining at social events can lead to weight gain. Not anymore.\n",
      "This book is a pleasure on the mind. A good old fashioned sword-wielding adventure in which Casca and his band of new mercenaries, made up from different tribes, must rescue the princess from a foreign land.<br /><br />With a daring trip along the river by boat, the band must save the crew and a rather dodgy captain from the attack of the tribesman, who have a vendetta against Mattias. As the tale unravels, one of the group is killed and Casca begins to investigate, who was it? As the clues drop he begins to suspect that all is not as it seems.<br /><br />Not everyone is who they claim they are, and it was a fascinating and brutal end to the story. Saddler would have been chuffed if he could have written this, I don't mean to over do it, but without offending anyone, I think mr Roberts is becoming just as big a talent as Saddler ever was.. There isn't much between the stories mr Roberts is producing now and the best from Saddler.<br /><br />Just like to point out that Mattias is such a great character, the best in any of the Roberts era, bar casca himself obviously.<br /><br />I vaguely remember someone saying in an earlier review that mr Roberts tried to make casca seem like a '1970s touchy feely guy'.. I think this book is more than enough to dismiss that claim as pure ignorance and retardedness.<br /><br />Excellent work mr Roberts, keep it up!!\n",

      "I received these screen protectors today, and could not be more pleased! I dropped my phone recently and cracked the screen. Although it did not affect the functionality of the device, I had been keeping Saran Wrap over the screen to keep glass particles out of my fingers. This was less than satisfactory, due to the wrinkles. The protectors are smooth and glossy, just as the original screen was (before cracks). So far, not a single fingerprint or smudge has appeared, like were on the screen before. I highly recommend this item! This will buy me some time for use, while I try to decide on repair versus total replacement (all of which are expensive options). No matter which option I choose, I will continue to use these protectors.\n",
      "It's truly a fun read book.The author had worked hard to write this historical journey. This book is just like a novel for me where Leonard is character between all this suspense, intrigue, horror, and power struggles. Overall Leonard is a very talented man in styling hair. Most of the times his clients include ladies of the court and the most important lady, the queen of France. I know after reading this book you will truly admire this man's gumption. Such a fascinating life this man has.\n",

      "Pros:<br />I love Razer packaging. I believe it is the start of the experience and design that shows they pay attention to detail.<br />This product is very easy to instal and setup. The wide variety of settings and possible programing make it ideal through several types of games and uses.<br /><br />Con:<br />While it is wireless, the wireless requires the included base. This is fine for desktop uses, but for a laptop it would have been nice to see Bluetooth like the Razer Orochi.<br /><br />Overall I love the Razer family of mice so far, and will be looking into their keyboards next.\n",

      "I am impressed with this product, first as protects the screen, down the stairs I dropped and it was not absolutely nothing to the screen, besides that is doing very well to the screen and looks very nice, I really recommend it.\n",
      "This screen protector is the best one I have ever used because it contains no fingerprints or smudges even if I touch my screen a million times a day. The piece of glass is made from an oleophobic coating that prevents fingerprints and oil stains left on your screen. I was super happy about that because smudges can really ruin the clearness of my window display.\n",

I was glad the day i came across this selfie stick on amazon and i received it as a gift from this amazing seller. I really cant wait to get my hands on it after it was shipped from the seller, my selfie experience is now an awesome one, i give this selfie stick an A***  because its really awesome.

      "This is my first time writing a review for a vibrator so I'm not sure what to say other than using it feels amazing. I think the price is pretty much reasonable since I can definitely say this is high quality product and I urge others to go and give it a try too.\n",
      "I think the reason supplements get such widely mixed reviews is that everyone is looking for a magic pill. They want to make no other changes, take a pill and want the fat to melt away. I have never heard of anything that's ever happened like this.<br /><br />Personally I was in what is considered the 'overweight' range for my height and build. Everyone said I looked great and scoffed at the idea of being 'overweight', but I kind of felt it. Clothes were getting snug and I wasn't comfortable with my own appearance. So I set out to get into the 'healthy' weight range by dropping 20 lbs. or so. I started a regular regimen of exercise and began to watch my caloric intake. After about 8 or 9 weeks I had plateaued after losing about 12-13 lbs. It was frustrating - my weight even slipped up a bit even though I continued my diet and exercise program.<br /><br />I did the research on coffee bean extract. Naturally the reviews are all over the place. I figured I didn't have a lot to lose by trying it out, so I got a bottle of this stuff. I'm through the first bottle now and the weight loss is staggering. I immediately blew through the plateau and I've dropped another 10 lbs. in 4 weeks. I've reached my goal but now I'm getting greedy. I'm wondering whether I continue losing to get to the mid-point of the 'healthy' range. I'm very close and there's still a bit of flab here and there that I'd like to see go away. I did still continue with my exercise program at the same time.<br /><br />Again, if you're looking for a magic pill move on. In my opinion, and I'm certainly no expert, these supplements only work in combination with changing the behaviors that got you overweight in the first place. This one seems to work extremely well when applied in that fashion.\n",
      "I bought these as birthday gift for my girlfriend after another pair she had would not stay up any more time. I have to say, they are really attractive and fit very well. Even after some vigorous.....exercising, they did not move an inch and stayed up beautifully. These are very sleek and sexy. She used these to put on in her webcam show, where she does some very active dancing. These stockings not only looked amazing, but they did not move the entire time she was gyrating all over the place lol. These are really the bomb on my wife, she has great looking legs and these really set them off, best advantage is they keep up.\n",
      "The design was cute + the sound quality was really great, it doesn't have any buzzing sounds on it. Also it was easy to carry as it was lightweight and can be put in your small bags.

      "I would like to share how effective Forskolin Extract with Garcinia Cambogia is for me. These are the effects on me after a month:<br /><br />1. It made me lose 25 pounds in one month. It made my belly slimmer which I believe has the most stubborn fats on my whole body.<br /><br />2. It suppressed my appetite so much. I usually eat 3 heavy meals a day and 3 more snack time every time I feel the urge to eat. But after a week of taking it, I already felt full after a heavy meal in the morning, and would just east light meal in the afternoon with no snack time in between because I still feel full.<br /><br />3. I have experienced no unwanted side effects like dizziness, headache or anything unfamiliar.<br /><br />This really made my life better and I am so thankful that I have found this Extract by Bio Green. I recommend it to everyone who wants to lose weight.<br /><br />- Ana Thorpe, Helen Thorpe's Sister\n",

      "Used to be when I'd travel by plane, I'd bring a book, a stack of magazines, a large bottle of water and of course, I able to wear shoes with laces. Obviously, there's a new world order and traveling means I have to stay in touch with everyone at all times! Besides hauling my Mac Book, I now bring my iPhone, iPad, slide on shoes and because of TSA restrictions, no water bottle.<br /><br />I'm not phased by dehydration. Like most travelers, my fear of all fears, is that my electronics will lose their power, while in midair! I get the shakes at being left with no phone to tell my family, friends and colleagues that I'm waiting on a line or bored. I also shudder at having no books, magazines or emails from work to read. After all, without any power, I am a broken man - dehydrated, staring at my slip ons.<br /><br />I'd heard that external batteries were an option but thought they were expensive, bulky and not dependable. After hearing my son Alex rave about his battery pack, I decided to read some independent reviews and take a cyber stroll to Amazon. Review after review highlighted PBS's superb quality, reliability and features. However, my foremost reason for going with PBS was their excellent customer service. I noticed that if in fact there was a negative review, Anker remedied each and every malady. As a result of my research, I decided to order the PBS, PBS Smart 7000mAh External Battery Pack  for $35.99, at Amazon.\n",
      "What a fantastic deal! I got a huge box of these for a great price. I love carrying these in my purse and in my backpack. I take them all over with me. I like these better than the little bottles of hand sanitizer because they do not squish out. I have had more purses and bags ruined or drenched in sanitizer because of the little bottles. These wrapped wipes are perfect for me no leaking, no squishing, just perfect! I love them and love them scent! They are perfect for what I need!! You can also drop these in the kids backpacks for easy access too!! Don't forget camping season is coming up we are planning on taking these with us.\n",

Slightly raised above the camera on the back as well (although it's hard to realize.

The phone itself is really big and wide that it can not fit into my pockets without sticking out halfway. I can't risk putting it in my bag because it has many objects that can scratch or scrape the phone like keys, paper clips, and coins. That's why I decided to purchase this clear case to preserve my phone's original appearance. t does a great job in sealing up every corner and edge of the phone to prevent any dust from getting trapped inside. Such an amazing case to purchase at this affordable price with excellent quality.\n",

      "I started exercising and losing weight and getting into shape about a year ago and let me just tell you it has been the most rewarding journey for me, I look great and I feel better than I ever have in my life. I owe part of it to these pills. These raspberry ketones are all natural and all pure, so basically 100% pure raspberry ketones, with nothing else added to it, they also supply 500mg of raspberry ketone which is a high dosage and will surely help. I started taking them late last year and they have put me on the right track.<br />I have managed to lose about 35 pounds during the whole journey and I couldn't be more proud. This wasn't all accomplished through the pill, I wish it was that easy but the fact is I had to work and I had to work hard! This pill combined with proper diet and exercise can help you reach your weight loss goals. If you're already on a diet and exercise scheme and needing a little help, try these pills.\n",

      "Light, comfortable, and insulating pot holders great for taking pots and pans off the stove or for handling hot bowls that just came out of the microwave. Great for emergency spills too, since these are made of cotton. Lol!\n",

By far the best test booster I have tried. I'm 44 yo and my recovery time is so quick lately I am increasing workouts to 6 days a week.\n",
      "i had a hard time finding a cable like this anymore with people leaning in more to iPads and iPods. I'm just lucky to find this item online.

      "I really like this coconut oil. It is great because the whole family can use it. It comes with a very convenient pump which is wonderful to help with portion control when my children use it.

      "I have used this for both iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 plus. Holds either fine without issues.This has a very strong suction which is sometimes hard to find but a must have for this type of device. The angles make it very flexible to get the right angle to exactly see your phone wherever you place it on your windshield and they hold in place. Very pleased with this purchase.\n",

      "The only thing I don't like about this heater--is that my parents did not have it when we camped long ago! This quickly heats up the tent, is easy to use, and simple to transport. We have two, one for the adult tent, one for the kids' tent. We don;t go camping without it.\n",

People regularly ask me about it and compliment the small size, design and cool light cycles.<br />I just received a second diffuser for my home and I'm over the moon about having another to enjoy when I'm relaxing at home or need a vaporizer to put next to one of my little girl's bedrooms for an evening. They are so much simpler to set up than a large humidifier and with the automatic shutoff, they are super convenient and give me a little peace of mind also.<br />Thanks Deneve for a great product!\n",

      "I recently relocated and had to buy a lot of household items. My search for a coffee-maker led me to the SterlingPro French Coffee Press and I must say I am impressed! The cleaning is simple. I can use both coarse and fine coffee with it. The coffee grounds don’t get into my cup because of the double filter system. I loved the great customer service offered too when I called in to make an inquiry. Thumbs up to the manufacturers!<br /><br />\n",

      "I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I love it. Taste wise, its not the best but the pill is easy to swallow.  It is not a magic pill so you need to do some exercise.  Just try cutting back on how much you eat. Add a banana for a snack , or serve yourself the regular amount that you usually would and then cut it down the middle and only eat half.  Remember to drink a lot of water during the day. And lastly eat a great breakfast!  Cut out the pop!  If you try eating small snacks during the day to keep your metabolism constantly working fast... You will shed the pounds ;) Hope this helped-\n",
      "developed a deep interest in receiving a good massage when I was younger. Over the years my love for being massaged, and even giving massages, has not subsided at all.

      "I'm a long-distance runner. I keep in shape by doing at least 5-6 miles a day, I run marathons and 10ks whenever I have the chance. Running is almost a form of meditation for me. But as I've gotten older it's been harder and harder to cover the same distances, even at slower paces. Worse still, I had started feeling completely wiped out for two or three days after a big race. I thought I might have to give up my running, or at least cut way back. I was just tired of being tired all the time.<br />Estrovoid totally turned things around for me. It hasn't made me faster or improved my stamina, really, but since I've been taking it my recovery times have gone way down. Soreness and aches and pains are all much less now than they were before I started taking this stuff. I don't know if it would work as well for everybody, but I think it's at least worth trying.\n",
      "One often does not know the quality of a product from just looking at a picture online.  I needed a new grater and liked the looks of this one.  I was very pleased when it arrived and I saw what high quality it is.  This grater is very sturdy and will last a life time if taken care of properly.  I really like that it is 6 sided and provides many more options than my old 2 sided one did.  The top handle has a wide width and allows you to get a good grip on it.\n",

      "Product contains Vit. E and C and they both found to be good for skin. Within few weeks time I have more vibrant skin and the cleanser hydrates the face well and do not leave it stretchy as other chemical based lotions or face wash do. It has even taken down my wrinkles near eyes. Surely recommendable.\n",
      "In 2011, the journal of gastroenterology found that green coffee bean increased average weight loss by 5.5 pounds in THREE different studies. This was on an extremely low dose of only 200MG a day. If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't have bought a supplement like this, but the evidence is hard to ignore.<br /><br />Naturabest's bottle recommends a dose of 800mg, which is considered the appropriate amount for this supplement.<br /><br />I personally started taking this supplement 3 weeks ago, taking ONE dose per day, on my way home from work, before dinner. I really started noticing a reduction in appetite after about one week taking the supplement religiously, so it may take that much time or longer for you. Since I started taking green coffee bean extract, I have lost 6.5Lbs total.<br /><br />I have toyed with the idea of taking two doses per day, but I'm in no huge rush to lose weight (I have been overweight my entire life), and don't want to overdo it. I AM losing weight, and I WILL keep it off, and this supplement is helping me accomplish that in an easier way than I would have ever thought possible before. This brand seems on par in price with other brands, I picked this one because it was the first one that showed up when I searched on amazon and it wasn't dishonestly priced (sometimes I worry about products that seem a little too cheap).<br /><br />I will continue buying this product until I have reached my goal weight (22.5 more pounds to go), and then I will take this as-needed once I am there.\n",
      "This is an excellent product. I was starting to worry about my dog, he is just too lazy, so I though there was something wrong with him, I took him to the vet and he told me he was fine, he just needed a few vitamines.<br /><br />I bought this product for him and there has been a lot of improvements, he is more active, with more energy, he responds when I call him.<br /><br />Thanks for these supplements, for real, you guys changed how my dog behaves with me.\n",
      "Fast delivery and good packaging.<br />Great product for digestion. This comes in a powder capsule form which I believe is a higher quality and pure blend of the 3 herbs, as compared to the tablet or pill forms that contain other ingredients. Take 1-2 capsules AM and PM.\n",
      "This gave me the burst of energy I needed. I’ve always been the adventurous type and I love discovering new things. However, all humans have their limitations and as much as I want to go out all day I cannot since I’m not getting any younger. Thanks to this green coffee bean capsules I get to enjoy more than I used to before. I’m going to continue using this and go all out all day!\n",

      "This is a great price on this product. I have seen supplements like this and even ones that contain similar ingredients that are much more expensive.

      "I bought this because I like the fact that the case is plastic, instead of glass. The glass I've had bad situations with, it's shattered before, and Has shattered my whole phone. The plastic case has made it so my phone doesn't break when it's dropped, and I'm able to get it on easily, and faster. The plastic case just slips on, and doesn't require much force. It's affordable, and is honestly the best protection for my Galaxy I've came across.\n",

      "Great entry level R/C boat with awesome features. The low battery alarm removes any concerns about getting the boat stranded I the middle of the lake. The self-righting feature works well (from what I can tell, it works by using the torque of the motor when you alternate from reverse to forward quickly). The boat is hard to capsize on smooth, calm water; however, it flips over easily in rough water. The hull seems very durable. The digital transmitter has great range and uses the same frequency spectrum as cordless telephones (much better than the older transmitters that use the standard telescoping metal antenna). Great boat for the price.\n",

The first thing that I noticed was that they are very convenient to carry around due to the way they fold up. They fit easily into my purse for when I am on the go. It has a really soft feel to it! A problem I have with pads is that I have allergic reactions down there so I have to be very careful. These did not break me out and are so easy to use. I clip it on and it stays in place. When I am done I fold it up and then throw it in the wash when I am home. The reusable pads do not let it leak and come in handy. I was offered this as a promotion for my honest opinion.\n",

      "This 5 hour energy drink is something special. It really works for me and is a much better alternative to coffee, which I will not drink (saw my dad actually become addicted to coffee and then every time he would try to stop got incredibly awful withdrawal headaches). Personally, just taking a few sips of this thing can keep me going for a couple of hours straight, which means that the product lasts a long time.<br /><br />For those who would prefer a tea type of drink that gives a lot of energy, I have also recently tried this one (works great for me): [[ASIN:B00IDXDQ9I All Natural Organic - High Energy Caffeine Instant Black Tea Powder (Over 100 Servings Per Package) - Buy One Get One Free!]]. I like this because the energy kick that it provides is very smooth. It is strong, to be sure, and you will feel it almost right away, but it also tastes really good (which is a big advantage for all you 5-hr energy drinkers). The added caffeine is what makes this effective, so it might not be something you want to use every day, but for when a nice burst of continuous energy is needed, this comes in quite handy.\n",

It is the first dietary supplement I'm taking and I was a bit wary. My friend got one, too, and she agreed to be my \"test subject\". After two weeks of intake, there's a visible lessening to her  waistline. When we eat, she gets full so easily that she actually complains about it when she really likes what she's eating! After three weeks, she'd lost about 7 pounds. The best part is there are no side effects that I know of and she seems to feel great all the time. It's a week now, and I have gone through what she's going through, and have also already lost 3 pounds to my weight. I think it's really working like a charm.

I live in an apartment complex and having a pet means constantly keeping my Scottie under leash and keep him as quiet as possible. All was going well until a few months back when he started this weird fantasy of barking at any and everything that moves. And that means a constant source of noise the ENTIRE day! At first I thought it was a phase and would soon go away, but even after a few weeks, it kept going on. One of my neighbors in the complex suggested me this collar after having successfully used it on her dog. I waited a few more days but when it got unbearable, I had to order it.<br />It's been 2 weeks now since I have been using this on Scottie. And believe me when I say this, my home is much more peaceful now! Even without the collar, he doesn't bark as much. I think he is trained now! I am gradually going to stop using the collar if he keeps up with this!\n",

When I noticed that this one had great reviews I decided to give it one last shot before giving up. I'm really glad I did because this is much better than the other brand I was using.

      "This product has done a superb job of really lowering my blood pressure. As a side note, I started taking this for blood pressure, but noticed a slight... \"viagra\" effect, each time I take the recommended dosage on an empty stomach. I also started taking tribulus, [[ASIN:B006QRHMWU 25 Grams (0.88 Oz) Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder (Strongest Tribulus on the market)]] which enhanced these effects ten-fold. Not the reason I initially sought out this supplement, but you won't hear me complaining. The powder form of L-Arginine (and anything for that matter) is something I prefer over pills since the cost gets cut in half, literally and I notice taking the powder has a more immediate effect rather than waiting for the capsules to disintegrate. Either way, L-Arginine is a terrific solution for lowering the blood pressure and upping performance in the bedroom, and a little bit of tribulus doesn't hurt either ; )\n",

      "Been taking the digestive enzymes for 6 days in a row (breakfast, lunch and dinner). It took a few days but after around the 2nd or 3rd day...wow...I am barely in pain any more. Symptoms including bloating and pain in my stomach have subsided big time. I think it wil get even better after using it longer.

I recommended them to my sister who has similar digestion woes like me.\n",

My friends are makings significant progress, they look slimer and they are constantly losing weight. Unfortunately, for me  progress is rather slow.

      "Poison Study is a great beginning to the Study series. The book is about a girl named Yelena who is next in line to be executed for murder. But she is given a choice by the chief of security. That choice is to either become the food taster for the Commander of Ixia or to die for her crime of murder. She chooses to become the food taster. Follow Yelena as she discovers secrets about her past that even she never knew about herself.<br />  The greatest strength for this book is the appealing storyline in which everything is in perfect order and nothing is either spread thin or too concentrated.<br />  Although the storyline is strong, however, the plot has a few holes in it. For example, the author would introduce a character but you would never see that character mentioned in the rest of the book. Other than that, this book was an awesome read which I wouldn't mind reading again.\n",

Until now, I could never find an affordable useful product that helps heal these issues.  In fact, I was skeptical at first because I never heard of such a product until I spoke to my chiropractor.  She uses it in her office for her clients and uses it at home as well.  She said it was new and provides consistent deep tissue stimulation to muscles and skin...she was right.  This is one of the few products that is not only affordable to buy as a patient, it actually works without any difficult technology or energy use.  If you are looking to rub out sore muscles, this is a must have product.  I use it at home watching television.\n",

      "I just had to get two of these starter packs when my niece had her twins last May. It comes with bottles, a bottle brush, a pacifier, and a training cup.  I remember how new parents can get real bogged down on what to get their first child. Starter packs like these can allow them to use their money for something else the child needs. I also like the tops and covers that come with this pack because it makes preparation and travel convenient for mommy.  I wish someone had given me a starter pack like this when I was first pregnant because it really would've made life easier.\n",

      "Not what I expected but most definitely surprised. I heard that this novel was written by a new writer and decided to dive in and see what she could produce and wasn't disappointed. The story had twists and turns that I didn't expect in a vampire story, a genre I don't usually read, but it held my attention to the end. As soon as I reached the middle of the book, I literally couldn't put it down until I reached the last page.

I love how it is so powerful and gets every drop of juice from the lemon or lime out. I also like that the juice does not squirt all over. In the past on my previous juicer I have had juice squirt in my eyes all over the counter and not go where I wanted to go. Now the juice falls straight down to the glass. No seeds and no pith, that is trapped in the bowl. I have been looking for recipes now that use citrus juice since this is so easy to use for me. Fresh lemonade or lemon bars very easy to make now.<br /><br />The press is made of food-safe aluminum material with a beautiful coating. It won't rust, scratch, pit or crack. Plus, it's has the strength to give you many years of reliable use.\n",

      "This RTGS 30 Micro LED Super Bright string lights with green wire are amazing. It can fit for your purpose either for indoor or outdoor use due to the waterproof design.  There are several settings which are much more sophisticated than those you get on Xmas tree lights, house plant, or other decorative projects.

I used them mainly to decorate my house plant and the upcoming Christmas tree and the result is amazing.  The LED lights are bright, fresh, clean and crisp.  The light includes 30 LED lights with 10' in length green flexible wire.  The lights are water proof and it requires 6 of AA batteries to operate.  The battery could last up to 14 days and the on/off timer setting is great.    I like the fact this LED light features 8 operating functions that can be activated by pressing button consecutively with simple and easy set up.  1. Combination  2. In Wave  3. Sequential  4. Slow Fade / Every Other Light  5. Chasing / Flash  6. Slow Fade / All Lights  7. Twinkle / Flash  8. Steady On    Overall, this RTGS 30 LED Micro LED lights is absolutely beautiful and is perfect for any decoration project and Christmas tree decoration with a great value.

      "After using this product for about 2 months I've seen results, i've definitely lost at least an inch off my waist. Drink a lot of water and try maybe 30 minutes before instead of the recommended 2 hours. Because cmon it's kinda hard to predict when you'll have a chance to eat especially if you have a busy day. What I do is whenever im feelin a little hungry I just go ahead and take the pill and then I distract myself for about half an hour and then boom chow down. Using this got me a motivated to go to the gym too just to try and further receive some results, but trust me im not doing anything too exhausting there. So for me personally, dropping soda and drinking water, Im working towards my goal. Hopefully this helps.\n",

It also protects the headphone jack from getting anything in it. The bracelet is gorgeous. It shuts very easily and there is no worry about a clasp with this item. It stays on securely. The necklace chain seems to be just the right amount of length. Clasp on the necklace is easy to open and closes nicely. It seems durable as it hasn't broke yet and I have worn this for over a week daily to check. I have also messed with it as well. The chain is really dainty but hasn't ripped and I am pretty notorious with doing that. The charm is brilliant. It shimmers and shines and the gem seems to catch the light at all the right angles. This is a cute set.\n",

      "I wanted to remove an old scar on my knee that was good sized so I went to my doctor. My doctor said to search for a scar remover on amazon and I found this! I used it for a few days and BOOM, the scar was pretty much faded away. You can only see it if you look closely, and it will probably disappear soon.\n",
      "I am always trying to make my nails stronger, and my hair stronger. I am on the constant lookout for products that will help that. I was offered this as a promotion and jumped at the chance. My honest opinion is that it is great. First off it is a huge container of powder. I started adding it to my chocolate milk. I throw it in my shaker bottle so that I make sure that it dissolves fully. When adding it with milk I can't really taste the citrus flavor. After just a few days My nails are slightly stronger. I also have joint pains and it has helped those go away some.\n",
      "Really helps with curbing food cravings. No negative side effects so far. Works as advertised. What can I say, great product!\n",

      "I was looking for a portable speaker and decided to try this Free Spirit 12 by SoundPal.<br />I was surprised at the size of this speaker and has a huge difference in sound quality from my other portable speakers. I could definitely hear the lows and the highs and more importantly the bass. I selected this model in color black with the red dots.<br />The speaker did not take long to charge on the initial charge. I paired my iPhone with my new speaker and played a few songs from my device. I then listened to some music from Sirius and Pandora. I was definitely hearing vibrant and lifelike music.<br />I initially liked the &#34;voice&#34; that helps with the pairing of the devices. I can see how it might get annoying after awhile, but I didn't find how to turn it off anywhere in the user manual.<br />While connected to my iPhone, I can adjust the volume from my device or from the speaker.<br />I'm very happy with my purchase. Money well spent. I do highly recommend this speaker.\n",
      "I got this , and I'm so impressed with it! It is  screen protector, almost like a very thin case. I was worred about using it, thinking that as thick as it is, there's no way it could be as responsive as the little flimsy cover that was on my phone... but it's just as responsive. And it does appear to be a lot more fingerprint-resistant than the one I was using.<br />I got a  screen protector  + with a wet cleaning wipe and a dry cleaning wipe and a dust-absorber.\n",
      "Perfect to keep energy up when in front of the computer all day. I ordered it to replace an old box style Ott light purchased many years ago. Replacement bulbs for that are no longer available and it had lost its brightness. I used to leave it on all day long. This light is VERY bright and I like the fact that you can use it for 30 to 60 minutes. I probably have it on for 30 minutes 3 to 4 times a day.\n",
      "I used these to make cupcakes this weekend and when I poured the thick liquid ingredients (cake mix) into the molds they maintained their shape very well and did not collapse when I filled them to about 1cm from the top. The cupcake molds were not effected by the high temperature of the oven and the cupcakes looked very good.\n",
      "Pros:<br />It has Google Play Store to download apps you want<br />The box has three USB ports, which can connect different USB devices at same time (mouse/keyboard/hard drive/USB/Webcam)<br />Point remote control is good for playing games<br />Preload XBMC<br />HDMI cable included<br />Cons:<br />Remote control is a little sensitive, so need some time to get used to<br />Its better if can make interface simpler.<br />Overall, this box is still good, for me, android TV box is much better than streaming only player, because you can do much more things on your TV through this box.\n",

      "I read this book 2 1/2 years ago, loved it then, still love it now!  I don't remember how much detail the author gave on nootropics but it was after reading this book I began my quest to sharpen my mind and improve my overall cognitive functioning.  This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.<br /><br />Besides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).  They were first discovered 30+ years ago and were used to treat serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.  Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.<br /><br />They are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.  Besides experimenting with a few nootropics, I've been taking ginseng and ginko for years, [[ASIN:B009K30D28 Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly (1000 Mg) + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract (30 Mg) 60 Tablets]].  They're inexpensive and effective, plain and simple.<br /><br />And of course if you haven't already, read this book which, for me, was my personal inspiration and the beginning of my journey to a better me; [[ASIN:1594480931 The Better Brain Book]].\n",

      "Very fruity and delicious. The taste is phenomenal. It is a very excellent and welcome alternative to expensive fat reducing surgery. Plus it suppresses appetite, so you eat less. The fact that it is all natural beats every other product out there, including surgery.

      "I bought this case for my brother, as he's a massive music addict and a very active person. He's listening to music everywhere he goes, whether it's while going into the tub or actually climbing at a mountain, he doesn't care where or when, he needs his music. He already broke 2 phones that way, and with his rather new iPhone 5s I didn't want that to happen.  After dropping it on the floor, dipping it in water and mud and scratching it on rock, I must say this case is perfect for hardcore usage. Of course there's signs of usage all over the case, scratches and dents, but it never failed its purpose. My brother's phone is still alive, and the apparent solidity of this case will make sure that it will stay in this state.\n",

      "Great price and a quality product for fine grinding. Silver color, looks much more expensive than the price tag. You won't be disappointed unless you have unrealistic expectations. This is a nice tool to have at a very good price. Con: No cleaning brush included as the photo shows. Mine came packaged in a thin plastic bag with no padding and no way to close the bag. But no damage in the box which did have additional cushioning inside. For the price, you can beat it man. In a hemp shop these things run for 4x the price. This things works great when grinding up your cough cough &#34;herbs and cooking garnishes&#34; :) For the price, you can beat it man. In a hemp shop these things run for 4x the price.

      "I have been using screen protectors since my iphone 3G. By far these are one the best I have ever tried. Much cheaper than the invisible shield from Zagg I got back then. 3 piece under 10 bucks. You can't beat that. Quality-wise, it is at par with the major brands. I had no issue applying my first one without any big bubbles. It is very clear and while worth the $. Highly recommend.\n",
      "I love how easy it is to put the protection glass screen over my phone, it basically just slips onto the phone. I've already dropped my phone, and it hasn't shattered so I Would say the glass is exactly what it says, super impressed! It has lasted longer than any glass protection I have bought since along time, my phone reacts with my finger with the glass on which is a super plus, previous models didn't, I would have to take the glass screen off, and put it right back on. This one is the best protection in my opinion!\n",
      "Everyone who runs knows how uncomfortable is to have your phone in pocket. it can  fall out  while running. My friend recommended me to buy this and I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did. It doesn't stick when sweating. You will enjoy your music while workout. Just try this and you will thank me later.\n",

      "Item arrived quickly and well packaged. Been using it for about 3 weeks and so far it is working great!\n",

Will definitely recommend.\n",

Their products are valuable. If you read the literature available on bee products its amazing stuff. Really amazing because its nature's cure for a great deal of ailments. Short story is that this is a fantastic product.\n",
      "This case gives me a sense of security when using my ipad. It's really protects nice and it's REALLY functional. Best of all, it hardly adds anything to the size of the ipad. I give it my full recommendation. It doesn't rotate to the picture frame view but it is still a really great case.\n",

      "love this stuff, but i have learned you really have to follow the directions and take it before you go drinking and before bed.  if you wait until you start getting the spins it won't work and you will still get sick.  so take it as it's intended, as a preventative.  the charcoal will soak up the alcohol and give you a good base to drink on.\n",
      "This is surely the best thing we could have done for our relations it makes them much less brisk and so much passionate\n",
      "I tried this product with plenty of water and did not need to take it with meals.  I prefered to take it 2 hours after a meal.  It seems to have extended the time till I felt the need to eat again and did eliminate the snack craving in between.  I did not have any stomach problems or nausea. The product does not have a nasty aftertaste and can be swallowed fairly easy. I did not notice a huge weight loss, but I also do not stick to a regular diet and exercise and should I have done so I am sure it would have worked a lot better.\n",
      "My wife and I got this for a wedding present a beautiful 9 piece kitchen set, and we absolutely love it. They are strong and sturdy and easy to clean. The set looks great in our kitchen too. This set it great for any kitchen... I'm Planning to get one for my mom.\n",

      "I had this tempered glass screen protector for about two months now and it works like a charm. For its price it is very cost efficient and easy to put on.

Therefore you can go wrong with this cost efficient tampered glass screen protector fits perfectly on the iPhone 6, no problems. it was really cheap, so I'm not complaining. From receiving it, the screen was in perfect condition and it's real glass.\n",

      "I'm thinking that I will review this along with the moringa capsules because I'm taking both right now. I got the moringa for migraines and garcinia for losing some weight this holiday, instead of the opposite tendency. Keep in mind it could be the combination that is helping but the migraines are far less frequent or severe. As for weight loss all I can say is that it is making a dent in my appetite, so that's nice and hopefully will get me through the holidays with a decrease in my weight. We will see and for now I feel satisfied eating less often so that earns five stars.\n",
      "I really wanted a portable monitor, and lucky me got this one for my birthday from my husband! I just absolutely love it! I am part of a direct sales company, so I connect it to my laptop and use it for picture displays of the product, and placing orders. I also have used it hooking it up to my phone so that I could see the screen better to read something important. It has worked wonderfully every time I've used it, and I'm so glad that I got this monitor. What a wonderful way to make my life easier. Great product!\n",
      "I ordered this product and received it quickly. I have been taking the green coffee bean extract for about a week now. I have lost 2 pounds with no change to my regular activities and diet. I'm not sure if this is normal, but I have noticed a decrease in my appetite as well as my cravings for sweets. Within a few days I experienced more energy than I've had in a long time, and my days have been more productive since then. I love that this one does not make me jittery. I would definitely recommend it!\n",
      "That's how good this stuff is, as soon as I noticed I was getting low, I ordered a second bag of this tea so I wouldn't run out.  Not only would I miss my favorite morning flavor, I'd also miss the completely relaxed zen state it helps put me into.  It helps suppress your hunger to facilitate you lose weight, the flavors are amazing.\n",
      "I installed this about a week ago. I print quite a bit in my business and the quality of this toner is as good as the OEM I had been using. I will certainly continue to use this toner without a doubt.\n",

      "I'm a bit neurotic in general:) When it comes to by body I don't want it to get used to anything for fear that I will become immuned to effects. AT any given time I will have a minimum of 4 different hair/body products, toothpaste, vitamins, you name it. My diet and exercise regimen varies greatly by the day. I tried this and noticed that my abdomen looked and felt smaller and tighter the next morning. I loved it so I did not use the next day. I take it once or twice a week and love how it fits into my neurotic life.\n",
      "If your a parent, then you know how much of a struggle it is to get your child's temperature. Obviously the best is old school, but for convenient and almost accurate, this does the job. I didn't use the cover, but I think it is a plus.\n",

      "This is my 2nd spiralizer of this type and man is this one excellent. I was thinking that they were all pretty much the same. They're not. The blades are sharper, plastic stronger, and suction cups stronger. This thing is really perfected.The recipes are awesome.

      "This little device works perfectly as described. Really improved my facial skin. It's much softer which feels just great. It came with a set of directions to guide you how to use it properly as the vibration intensity levels can be a little tricky. Over all, a perfect product to keep your face at its best.\n",
      "The HTC One M9 is a recent new release. Before using this case, I need to buy a protective case for it and this is by far the best one I have bought. It provides all around protection. All exterior borders and back are sealed up giving it no chance to get damaged.\n",

      "Beware of cheaper belts! I actually prefer the buckles on REI and Eastern Mtn belts to this one, but this is still solid. Unlike \"military style\" web belts I have seen (and bought) on Amazon in the past, which have been thin, flimsy and cheap. They seem more like a woman's decorative fashion belt. Don't make the same mistake!\n",

      "I trust very few supplements in the market as there are a lot of unreliable or dangerous items being sold. I was careful when I took the first capsule and was relieved to find out that there were no unwanted side-effects.<br /><br />As a health professional however, I would urge folks to prevent the buildup of fecal matter through a healthy diet with lots of fiber. This will prevent future digestive problems.\n",

Once I found these inks I have not used anything else in years, because, well they get the job done very well.

After using this product my beard has felt so soft, that I decided to grow it long.  My wife loves it and so do all of my kids!  Heck, who knows maybe for X-mas this year I'll bleach it white!

In conjunction with this product I have seen MUCH faster results. If you can afford it, do both at the same time, it'll work better if you have darker spots. The ones on my back are almost gone. This product has nearly eliminated my post acne scarring.\n",

It is used also for peripheral nerve degeneration and also helps control blood sugar levels - so if you are diabetic is will help lower blood sugar.

      "There are so many companies making tempered glass. How do you choose? In doing my research I have discovered that one of the best choices is Besgoods. Their tempered glass is on the thinner size and while you may think that is not a good thing it actually is. It provides for a better fit in your iPhone 6 case, especially the cases with the built in battery packs.<br />You will get a HD ( high definition ) picture like none you have ever seen. The glass is rated 9H which is a very high rating for being scratch resistant. You will also see a big change since fingerprints and the oils they leave behind are a thing of the past.<br />The installation process is actually very easy but you must read the directions. You will find everything you need in the package. You start by cleaning off your phones screen with the wipe they enclosed, and then dry it. Then you line up the openings, and lay it down on the screen. You get no bubbles at all. If you need to move it you just carefully lift it off and do it again. There is no residue left behind. They did a great job with all the cutouts for the camera and everything else that made it easy to make everything line up.<br />You have to be crazy to use the old fashioned plastic sheets to protect your screen. They leave bubbles and don't protect your screen at all. Once you try Besgoods Tempered Glass you will use nothing else ever again.\n",

It's a padded vented canvas material that has been molded or formed into a ribbed 1/2 chevron design that rests against your back. The straps are relatively wide, but not as thickly padded as I had hoped. I'll update this review after a few months of use & let everyone know if the straps dig in too much. The molle strips on the top and middle of the back are a relatively short at 6&#34; long. I'm accustomed to 8 1/2.&#34; Six inches is probably OK for the average guy with an average backpack but it's almost too short for many of us.

      "There seems to be no shortage of cable standards on the market today, and there is no sign that these trends will tapper off any time soon. I've been perfectly happy with my component-cable connection for my audio devices. Sure, having too many components can be a major hassle and contributes to the proliferation of cables behind your electronic media center. But I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that my latest HDTV did not support component audio and I had to purchase a separate optical cable.<br /><br />Fortunately, Amazon offers a very competitively priced good quality optical cable. As I already mentioned, I haven't had much of an experience with these cables, but AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable seems to be as good as you could possibly hope for. It is durable, flexible, and long enough to connect any two devices. The sound quality is exceptionally good and only limited by the audio system that you are using. There is absolutely no reason to buy a more expensive cable from a different brand. I highly recommend it.\n",

I've pretty much just decided to avoid some of those other retailers all together and just go with Amazon.<br />So after getting it I in the end didn't return it. There wasn't a need. It was a solid purchase on my part for the money I spent. Plus when you buy from Amazon it comes directly to your door instead of having to drive somewhere and spending time finding the item in a store. Time is money friends!

      "This is an excellent bike pump with gauge! I have tried it on both my mountain, and road bikes. The bike pump is a nice size, but you don't sacrifice efficiency because it shifts air into the tire when you push the handle in and out. I have used it to completely re-inflate one of the 29&#34; tires on my mountain bike. It didn't take any time at all and I wasn't burned up at the end of it.

      "This dimmer cord helps for those lamps which don't dim on their own and one does not have a dimmer wall switch.<br /><br />My friend has one of these:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0000DI241/<br /><br /> I have about five of these in my home. All have worked well with no problems over the years. However, there is one thing that I would strongly point out. Not all of these dimmer cords have a light on the dimmer box. I accidently got one without the light and it makes it difficult to find in the dark. The light is turned on at the dimmer box and if there is no light on the box to tell you where it is in the dark room, it can be hard to find. This problem is solved if one makes sure that the dimmer box has a small light on it. The second thing that needs to be mentioned is that the outlet plug (into which the lamp plug needs to be inserted) is oriented perpendicular to the wall. If one has a lamp which has a similar outlet plug then with that lamp plug inserted in the dimmer plug which is inserted into the wall, the whole plug component is sticking about 4-6 inches out from the wall. If the outlet plug is behind a bookcase or furniture, this can be a problem. Even with a lamp plug that is flat, it will stick out several inches. Make sure there is enough space between the wall outlet and what is covering this unsightly mix of plugs and cords.\n",

The first time we turned it on, our 2 month old smiled and smiled. The remote control is handy and I love that it plays for 20 minutes. I don't know how long the batteries will last, but it is so much better than the wind up kind I don't care. It was easy to install on the crib and is very secure. I wish there were more volume settings (it has two). Even on the loudest setting it is kinda quiet. I would definitely purchase this mobile again or buy it for other future mothers for a shower gift.  We had a wind up mobile before purchasing this one and hated it. THIS one  http://fave.co/1bKZMXr We just put batteries in it last night, and I am in love with it!! So here it is from baby's eye view. :)  The only downside: the tiny screwdrivers that are needed for assembly. I had to search through my husbands computer kit to find one that was small enough.  In short, get the http://fave.co/1bL0y6U\n",

It covers everything, step-by-step, from choosing everything you want said at your ceremony, including vows, to extra special touches to add like a dove or butterfly release, to making it official and the paperwork and process. Another friend told me that they used the book to create their ceremony and then just gave it to the person they hired to marry them. Anyone wanting to have their wedding really reflect THEM and not the officiant or celebrant doing the wedding, should get this book and create a really special ceremony, something their guests will talk about long after the wedding.\n",

We have an old plastic squeezer that we bought from the grocery store, and its just terrible and I'm afraid its going to break each time. So glad I got to try this one. It really looks and feels like it will hold up through anything and will squeeze most of the juice out of any fruit you put in there. This squeezer works great for smaller/medium sized lemons and limes. You can get much more juice out of the lemons than hand squeezing.  If your lemons are too big, you can even cut them in quarters to fit and them use the squeezer. This squeezer is durable and very easy to use.\n",

My face is a lot brighter, the redness and blotchy discolored areas are lightening up as well as under my eyes and neck. It just seemed to pull my complexion together into one.<br />I did have a deep line on my forehead that has been there for years, I never thought anything would help because it was extremely deep. Also, some lines around my mouth where they show when I smile. The line on my forehead is gradually decreasing in depth and less noticeable and the wrinkles around my mouth are getting firmer with each use.<br />Getting the right amount of the serum out is easy. The bottle has a dropper that I can get a few drops out at a time which is plenty enough for my entire face. Really generous size as well. I would definitely recommend this to others.\n",

      "So far, great results.<br />I've been using Epique for about 6 months now and have seen definite improvements with my skin and the dryness. My skin tone looks more even and with less spots and blotches. The area around my lower cheekbones is more firm and has a lifted, tighter look.<br /><br />The bottle is an oz. Since using this I have barely used even 20% and that's with a twice a day application. It takes very little to moisturize with this and just a tiny amount will do in my opinion. It works well enough for just one pump.<br /><br />When applying to my face I did notice that it rubs in well and absorbs really quickly. It is not sticky nor does it leave a greasy feeling as some moisturizers do. I do not have many wrinkles though I did see improvement on my forehead where I have a deep line from a bad habit of squinting, it has faded a bit and is not so pronounced anymore.<br /><br />I didn't have any bad side effects or skin sensitivity with this or clogging of my pores. My face overall is smoother and soft after using this. I would recommend to other people based on my experience with it.\n",

For the price, this pump does exactly what it's supposed to do. I set up a domestic water system in my cottage. I collect rain water in a large 87 gallon rain barrel, then pump it through a couple of filters into a second barrel. When setting this up and testing, there was a shortage of rain (naturally!) so I filled it with a home garden hose. As the first tank filled, I activated the pump to send this water through the filters into the second tank. I was shocked to find that the regular house water system could not keep up with flow generated by the Flojet! With the system all set up and running, I have better water pressure in my primitive abode than I used to have in a normal house.\n",

      "The rechargeable batteries I had before weren't of such a good quality<br />but they did the work so I got this for my Note 3. These are of a much better quality.<br />There is no need to fiddle around with the charger to set it in the right charging position.<br /> Also it charges awfully fast. I think I got a great deal also as I got 2 batteries instead of 1.\n",

The quality of the product is good  and the controls are accurate.<br /> People always comment on it when they see it. I can use it for a very long time without any problems. I would probably buy two more for my nephews.\n",
      "My husband received this from a colleague for Christmas, and it's been a wonderful gift! He's always got a mustache/beard combo going and has been using regular scissors and a manual razor for daily upkeep. This tool just keeps it all convenient with one gadget instead of five, and we can even use it on his hair! It's built really well, too, so you know it'll last for awhile. Norelco is a good brand we've used before - the quality of this grooming system is just what I'd expect from them. Definitely a good investment!\n",
      "These work so great!! I am always suffering from ingrown hairs, they suck!! Getting them out from under the skin withe a normal tweezers sucked! These make it A LOT easier. They are supper pointy and sharp so you can get straight to the hair and not have damage all they skin around the hair in the process. If you suffer from ingrown hairs regularly like I do these are a must buy!!\n",
      "I've tried many other pest controllers but was never fully satisfied with any of them but after buying this product I can surely say it's working. I had problems past three many years and this product definitely helped take care of it and all the other birds and pets on my property. I installed the Yard Sentinel to repel skunks and armadillos from my yard. So I can guarantee it's really helpful\n",
      "i bought this as a gift for a friend of mine who has autistic twins. She has told me that I have created a \"pleasant problem\" in her household. She told me her kids want to play with these kits for hours on end and want to take what they have built the previous day to school. im glad her kids enjoy the kit. I plan on buying more in the future.\n",
      "Really good gaming mouse for a cheap price. It allows you to customize all your buttons to whatever you want. It is really easy to set up and the weight of the mouse is adjustable. However, I do not like the fact that you cannot change the LED color, but thats just an aesthetic thing so not a huge problem.\n",
      "This tea is quite good and when you add to the fact that it also provides a nice burst of energy, you have yourself a winning green tea in my book.  I usually drink it cold, although it tastes good hot too.  I drink tea daily, mostly for the taste and energy, but I am always happy to add antioxidants to the body whenever I can.<br /><br />I will also drink black tea which usually has a higher caffeine content for energy; [[ASIN:B00IDXDQ9I All Natural Organic - High Energy Caffeine Instant Black Tea Powder (Over 100 Servings Per Package) - Buy One Get One Free!]].  I do like the taste of the green tea better, but when it comes to using it as a source of energy, black tea still performs better for me.  This is also probably due to the fact that the instant black tea powder I use doesn't come in bags so it is easier to make a \"strong\" cup.  I will usually fill a large water bottle (about a quart) and add two heaping teaspoons of the tea powder, and sip throughout the day.  This works out to be a ton of caffeine but it keeps me wired like no other.<br /><br />This is why I like this green tea that comes with the ginseng so much.  It is not sooo much caffeine and I am using another source of energy besides just the caffeine content.  The ginseng, I'm sure, is what makes it so much more expensive but since I do not drink it every day, I think it is not that bad.\n",

      "All my life I have made coffee with a drip machine or K Cups. When my Son came home from school he brought home a French Press. I could not believe how much better the coffee tasted. I needed my own.<br />This ZYK French press is easy to use and easy to clean. I love the coffee. It has a stainless steel screen system so that no grinds get into your coffee cup. It also is great for tea.<br />There is no better and easier way to make coffee. This is the way coffee is suppose to taste.\n",

      "I have a complete set for other types of cooking, so this knife is solely for making sushi and that's a good thing. It's not thick enough for chopping meat and isn't really the best knife for veggies and such. I recommend this if you only want it for sushi.\n",

      "Lots of people have enjoyed the Annapurna Circuit using this guidebook, which is a well established successful independent guidebook, written by a trekker for trekkers. The mountains and views have not moved since the original research trek, nor have the villages, the GPS locations are the same, the distance between the villages is the same, the cultural descriptions are still accurate, the mountaineering history has not changed much. The prices have changed, but that's inflation for you! The lodge menus will have changed, I expect for the better. There is now a road to Chamje and from Muktinath, but you don't have to get on the bus if you don't want to.<br /><br />The guidebook is printed by Amazon for each order, it's called \"print on demand\" and it enables high quality independent publishers to compete with big publishers, like you-know-who. This Annapurna guidebook has been praised since it was first published and is a great way to plan your trek.<br /><br />All I can say in conclusion is get off your computer and go do the trek. It's the experience of a lifetime, and this guidebook will help you along the way, and help you have some fun too.<br /><br />Ian Johnson<br />ianpjohnson@yahoo.com\n",
      "When you enter the world of Ken Frazier and Sam Flagg, you never know what to expect.  In this tale, J.T. Prescott has masterfully succeeded in dispelling misperceptions often held about those within the retirement generation.  When retired seniors Ken, Craig and Bill invite the more youthful and physically capable Sam Flagg into their circle of trust, they band together and use their collective &#34;arts and crafts&#34; and set out on a dangerous mission to uncover a government conspiracy that involves killing an untold number of unsuspecting american people.  The supporting characters are really developed and well written. You can certainly expect exciting action scenes with unexpected twists and turns along the journey.  This is an entertaining and interesting read. Arts and Crafts has an underlying topic that left me with a feeling of hope and a renewed respect and admiration for a sometimes overlooked retirement aged population.  I was reminded about the special knowledge and wisdom that can only be taught by those who have a lifetime of experiences to share.  Looking forward to a sequel.........\n",
      "Very nice easy action. Takes very little pressure to staple a few pages together. Have not explored it's upper limit on how many sheets at a time it will do, but with 2 or 3 it's like a knife thru butter.<br />Has a great feel and looks sharp!\n",

      "The Youth Express Eye Gel is a great product for under eye puffiness and even dark circles. The recommended use is twice daily, so I use it in the morning and again before bed time. It's very hydrating and can be used on your cheeks and forehead as well to moisturize the skin and improve skin tone and texture. Just using it under my eyes makes me feel and look better, because let's face it...no one wants to have eye bags or crows feet. Right? Great product for those of us concerned with aging gracefully!\n",
      "I've had mine for a few months and it is still working like new. Its very functional. The back lit screen is a wonderful feature especially for such an affordable gauge. Easy to read, simple to use, seals well, and the auto shut-off is nice for conserving the battery which is potentially the only down side as it costs as much as the gauge to replace. Great buy for anyone who wants a simple digital gauge. This gauge is great and extremely dependable.\n",
      "I had my doubts about this charger at first. I was quickly impress on how good it performs. My galaxy is on the red (about 10% charge) when I leave work ( I commute for about an hour), I stream music throughout my whole commute and by the time I get home it's 80% charged. I'm impressed! I highly recommend this charger.\n",
      "I don't know what is special about this brush but it works! I have very thick curly hair. It tangles very easily and I have to brush my hair before I wash it otherwise I will not be able to get it untangled after I wash it. I ordered this and I tried it immediately on my dry hair, that had been brushed earlier, and the brush went through with ease and the bristles did not get caught and pull my hair hard at all. It is painless and quick! I cannot say enough about this! It is awesome.\n",

      "I recently purchased the \"HESI A2 Secrets Study Guide\" which is the companion product to this flashcard study system and I have to say that I am really glad I purchased both. These flash cards act as a great way for me to quickly and effectively learn for the exam, getting me in \"fighting shape\" for the big test I have coming up in about a week.<br /><br />The flashcards are filled with countless subjects of questions and answers for everything you will need to know to really ace the HESI A2 exam. From biology to chemistry, mathematics, grammar, nouns, ideal gas law, thyroid hormones and so much more. I've been having my roommate test me routinely throughout the day, even when I'm not officially studying, to get me ready for answering questions on the fly and really making sure that I have material as memorized and understood as much as possible, and I don't think I would be half as ready as I am without these little flashcards at my disposal.<br /><br />Combined with the \"HESI A2 Secrets Study Guide\", this flashcard study system really is your best better to properly study and past the test with flying colors. I've only had about a week and a half to study for this exam and I have about a week left, but I am totally confident that I have this exam in the bag and will be able to really continue my goal as a nurse.\n",
      "These cups were a lot brighter in color than I expected!!<br />I love how vibrant they are and they will definitely go with my little sisters &#34;my little pony&#34; birthday party!

This is a wonderful product and I would definitely recommend this to you especially if your always on cupcake duty. Lol\n",
      "This electronic helicopter was a gift for my friend's child and it turned out to be an excellent choice. The handheld remote is pretty simple to use and the range is surprisingly long. This toy is also very durable just like the title suggests. It has been crashed a few times and still works great and hardly has evidence of wear. I would definitely recommend this to keep children entertained.\n",

      "I am a coffee addict. I drink coffee from the moment I wake until the moment I go to sleep. Pretty much everyone in my family is addicted. When my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter sees a mug or cup in a book she says coffee with a big smile. Even though we don't allow her to drink it yet she knows what it is. I like trying new ways of making coffee and having it quick so when I could get this French press at a great price of course I had to. And since I love it so much I wanted to share my thoughts on it. First off it is very pretty. It's is a coffee pot that doesn't take much room and I don't have to hide away. I like that I don't need filters with it because I have accidentally ran out before and almost died when I did. It doesn't take a lot of coffee to fill it up and I can control the strength. It is easy to use also. I highly recommend this to everyone who drinks coffee.\n",
      "its a battery charger without the USB cord or plug, that you have to get on your own. so i tried a different brand USB (not Samsung) and the battery light kept blinking yellow (malfunction I guess as there is no user guide or product description with the packaging) so you have to use a samsung plug/cable to charge your extra battery. $50 for OEM, i'm keeping it but i cant recommend it\n",
      "There's a reason why other car chargers are cheaper than this one.<br /> I even saw one charger for $1! Unsurprisingly it has a tonne of 1 star reviews.<br />This one is a quality product. Happy with the purchase!\n",

      "I ordered this as a pack together with the shampoo and have only used it once or twice. Not sure of long term results but smells great and leaves hair unbelievable full and soft after.\n",
      "This is a great conditioning mascara! I have short and very light eyelashes and I have tried every conditioner out there to try and make them grow longer. This product actually worked, and I can see a difference after using it for around a month every day. It doesn't smudge or give me panda eyes, yet it washes off easily. It's consistency is perfect, it applies smoothly and doesn't clump my eyelashes together. One or two layers is sufficient to ensure full coverage. I wear contact lenses and this mascara is perfect - I haven't had any problems with eye irritation. This is the best conditioning mascara I have ever tried and I am very happy with the purchase! Five star product!\n",
      "Have always had a thin hair line and very course hair. Couldn't find a product to help me with this. The products I was using could not redeem it. Out to try this product and honestly the results were amazing. My hair line has come back and my hair looks healthier.\n",

      "I live in a very windy and dusty location and I really needed to find a good cover for my grill. This one is just perfect and extremely durable. The cover actually has a very thick and strong quality to it. I have been using this cover for the last 6 months and there have been some insane sandstorms in the area but the cover still holds perfectly. This is the kind of product that you can recommend to others with complete confidence that it will perform as required. If you have a grill this is the best way to protect it.\n",
      "First Impression - This TV looks nice. Clean front. It is extremely light. The base feels sturdy and big enough to support the TV without risk of falling over. It was simple to put together with 8 screws in the base.<br /><br />Just for some background, I'm upgrading from an old  http://fave.co/1bQLeWR  in the bedroom. I do have an HDTV in the living room, but it is also a Tube TV. There I have a  http://fave.co/1bAFXCb  TV that I bought about 7 years ago that was basically the biggest widescreen Tube TV made that I know of. Back then a Tube TV picture was much better and cheaper than Flat Panel.<br /><br />Setup - It has 2 HDMI's and then some regular RCA and Component hookups. My setup consists of Verizon FIOS Cable Box and a WD Live TV Media Player (to be replaced by a Boxee Box within the week, but that's another story). Plugged the Cable Box and the Media Player into each HDMI port using new Amazon Basics HDMI cables. The TV on-screen setup was easy enough to figure out without pulling out the instruction manual. Everything came up perfectly the first time with just a press of the Source button.<br /><br />Picture Quality - I tested the TV out with several different types of media and sources.<br />1) First with SD Cable. A little blocky up close, which may just be the source, but from a normal viewing distance, I the quality was just fine. The kids' cartoons were fine.<br />2) Second with HD Cable. This picture seemed really nice. Didn't see any kind of distortion. Seemed nearly as good as the HD Tube TV that I have downstairs from an 8 foot viewing distance. I was happy with what I saw.<br />3) Third with a normal 720p Video file via the Media Player. Picture was really nice in this case also. Everything seemed crisp. Very happy.<br />4) Finally with a fast motion 1080p Video file via the Media Player. This is where I expected the worst, but to my surprise, the fast motion scenes seemed fine also. I only tested a couple of files, so we'll see if other sceneshave a problem, but so far so good.<br /><br />Overall I was very happy with the picture quality. The colors on the default setting were pretty terrible, so I tried the presets and settled &#34;Dynamic&#34; Picture Mode and Cool Color Tone in the Picture Options setting which was pretty much perfect in all instances. Looked pretty natural with nice colors.<br /><br />Viewing Angles - Side viewing angles seemed really good. This was one of my pet peeves and most of my reluctance to move to a flat panel TV in the first place. Many flat panel TV's look terrible when you aren't watching it straight on. This TV seems to have much better side viewing than many of the competing TV's out there.<br /><br />Screen - The screen edges do have a few very faint white areas that I have noticed, but they are barely noticeable and only when the screen is completely black. I don't notice it at all when there is any kind of picture on the screen. I probably only see it because I am looking for it after reading a few comments about backlight bleed. For me, it doesn't seem like anything to worry about. I always buy SquareTrade warranties with all my electronics, so if the screen does have a problem, I will be set.<br /><br />Sound Quality - This is where I had the most trouble. Granted, I'm upgrading from a old TV, but out of the box, the Samsung sounded very hollow and words were hard to understand. It seemed to be completely missing any low end, not talking about booming bass, just lower frequencies seemed to be missing. I tried every sound preset that they had and all were pretty bad. I finally gave up on the presets and used the included 5 band Equalizer which finally did the trick. Per request, I posted a picture of the settings in the customer images section of this item. [THIS SECTION HAS BEEN UPDATED BELOW: I basically maxed out the low and high frequencies and made a bell curve of the middle frequencies, raising the one that controlled voices until I has happy. This seemed to do the trick just fine and I am now happy with the sound.] Granted, if you are expecting a booming surround sound feel, you're shopping for the wrong TV, but for what I think this TV is meant for, it sounds just fine.<br /><br />Bells, Whistles and Other Stuff - I haven't toyed with this TV too much yet. There are lots of menu settings to go through. The power button on the bottom of the TV seems pretty cool. It is like a combined button/joystick that pulls up a menu when pressed that you can use the button to move through, or just turn off the TV. I won't use it much since the Cable Box remote will do most of the work, but it is a nice to have since the actual TV remote will probably sit in a drawer once everything is set up. It does have a USB port that is supposed to play pretty much any type of media format. If this works well, it is a great feature. For me, I plan on continuing to use a dedicated Media Player, so I probably won't use this much, but for anyone else, it would save you $100 on having to buy a media player if you have a use for it.<br /><br />I've only had this TV for one day, but this is what I think so far for a pro/con list.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Energy Star cost of $6-$12 per year to operate. That just sounds crazy, but I'll take it.<br />2) Great picture quality, especially for the price.<br />3) Very good side viewing angles.<br />4) Easy setup and connection to Cable Box and Media Player.<br />5) Enough picture and sound settings to get the quality you want for your individual preference.<br />6) Fast motion scenes seem ok so far.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Sound presets are terrible, but can be adjusted manually.\n",

Being all battery operated the detector can be mounted anywhere with a clear line of sight across the driveway and the receiver I am amazed to find can be mounted up to 80 metres away. Yes there will always be false alarms as cats and even birds can trigger it but an excellent device which works well and gives early warning of anybody coming into your property.

Other features include dual USB outputs (one delivers 1A, the other 2.1A 5V), a four LED charge indicator, built-in emergency torch and extensive intelligent protection system against short circuits and over-current etc. The USB cable supplied also doubles to connect the full size USB output ports of the power bank to most smartphones, satnavs and cameras etc. however, I always use the original lead supplied with the device I want to charge. Apple users will need to supply their own charger cable.\n",

      "What a movie!!! & shame on those collages that are refusing to show it, because they are claiming it will offend muslims. Excuse me, the reason they have the FREEDOM to attend a collage is because these young men lay down their lives to fight for our countries freedom. Part of that is being able to attend a collage of their choice. I'm glad this movie was made, & God Bless Kyle & the men that fought with him. It's an eye opener as to what they are dealing with over there. This movie is a must see!!!!\n",
      "I love this product! It's a beautiful journal. I looked everywhere for a medium size journal/ sketchbook and when I came across the selection on Amazon this was the obvious choice.

      "This is my first iPad (Mini), my first iPad cover, and my first Amazon purchase. After purchasing I feel I navigating the reviews, products and prices quite well. I like the stand modes. My solitary complaint is the lack of a good way to prop it for typing. I like 5-10 degree angle, this one is about 15 degrees so I just lay it on deck of cards or something similar. The automatic power down is really nice and used constantly. The whole cover feels sturdy and protective of my precious machine inside. This is why I give it full score.\n",

      "I had purchased another DVD player on amazon but it died and I had to return it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ANVQWU?tag=a9000-20  After doing some research I came across this one! Features include the usual gamut plus a very nice speed-control which I've never seen on a DVD player (but then I'm not an aficionado so what do I know ha ha). Simply pressing that particular button on the remote allows one to speed up or slow down playback with FULL sound! Really cool. I'm going to like this button for chick flicks! (Shhh ... you didn't hear me say that!) LoL  It's also half the size of the now-deceased DVD player so I recovered some shelf space as well. Sweet.  I'll update this if there are any untoward events but my experience with Sony gear (going back to before the Walkman) has always been excellent. Hopefully this is an aspect of Akio's company that lives on.  I recommend you pick up one of these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00THLNVY0?tag=a9000-20  I hope this review was helpful. Ciao.\n",

Here's it's specialty though: I fell while carrying my phone and used the hand holding the phone to stop my fall and the phone took the main impact.<br />I picked my phone up expecting the worst and low and behold the screen saver is the only thing that took a hit. Not one scratch reached the main phone screen. I was very impressed.\n",
      "I spent alot of time in Zurich, Switzerland. The Swiss make awesome breakfast cereals totally unlike what we get in the US.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill müesli is darn good.

      "In know that this sounds repetitive but having a ceramic blade in my kitchen is really fantastic!!! Long have I been waiting for a gadget to be able to cut identical thin slices of my vegetables and fruits.<br />And my wife and I use this ceramic blade almost every day in making our stew, sauté and salads.  This was definitely worth it, a great tool that is easy use, keep and clean.\n",
      "This thing was a lifesaver during my pregnancy!!!  It is large and does take up most of my queen sized bed, however, that just meant I had more room on the bed!  I loved that you can switch from side to side so you're always able to get comfortable.  The cover isn't the easiest to get back on after washing it, but it's not impossible even at 9 months pregnant!\n",
      "Perfect for night/day moisturizer. The name says it all. It was a big part of my face clearing up. My face kept breaking out because I didn't have a good moisturizer, now that I have this breakouts are minimal and with the winter coming I feel prepare now. I will def be buying another one. So glad the search for the perfect moisturizer is over.. I was getting tired of looking.\n",
      "We would all appreciate a day at the spa and being pampered but for me that's  just not an option. Even though I can't afford to be pampered by professionals, I can get the same spa treatments at home. I purchased the Dead Sea Mud Mask from InstaNatural recently and have not only used it on my own skin, but shared with my daughter. Her face tends to break out so she was in need of some deep cleansing...the Dead Sea Mud Mask was just the thing! Her face was immediately clear of blackheads and her pimples were significantly diminished. Wow! I've used it as well and have seen great results. My skin is clearer, smoother and my fine lines are not nearly as noticeable. This is not only a great skin care product, but also awesome as an anti-aging product.\n",
      "I got the pink one ant it's wonderful. I had an otter case before and this case looks better quality yet much cheaper. Snapped onto my phone easily and looks great. Everything works as it should. Get this, you won't regret.\n",
      "These were just what I need to label my jars and other kitchen things. I like that they are removable. Even after pulling it off one thing and re-sticking it to another, it worked well and adhered. I used a cheapy chalkboard marker and it looked fine. I think a better quality one would have given it a more &#34;chalkboard look&#34;. The thing is, these are PVC... so you do get that sense that they are more plastic like labels, than matte chalkboard. But nonetheless - they are labels and they do what they are supposed to do.\n",
      "We have one of these in our apartment. I wish i could it was for decorative purposes.  but nah!  the bottles get replaced more often than we'd like.  It's a really cool bar for us.\n",

      "I couldn't put down this fast-paced, honest, young-at-heart memoir. The characters are as real in this story as I'm sure they are in the author's experience. Their portrayal reminded me of the characters from my own travels and the characters in my current classroom; most importantly, they evoked real emotion.<br /><br />Frustration, pride, loneliness, disappointment, and elation are feelings that I believe anyone who has traveled or taught can relate to. These are circumstances of so much good and so much unknown. While reading Abbey's story, I felt 23 again--I remembered the realization that teaching was way more then theory--I remembered feeling so hopelessly out of place in a foreign country that I wanted to disappear--I remembered the freedom that comes with embarking on an adventure--and I remembered how often the resolutions of change come throughout a lifetime.<br /><br />It's hard to graduate college and find your place in a grown up world. It's hard to move away from home. It's hard to know yourself well enough to predict where you will be at the end of every road. This book a story of teaching and partying in a small village in Taiwan, but it's really a story of friendship, patience, and the best time ever.\n",
      "It is a great resource tool for having the pertinent information, especially at clinical settings when the nursing interventions and focus are more important than the drug information itself. Lots of fun illustrations and helpful mnemonics to help with studying, as well.\n",
      "I was never satisfied with the iPhone 5 battery life. I was having to charge it twice a day. The 5s was a little better but still had to be charged every night. This case makes the phone a little heavy and bulky but since I've used it I don't even think about my battery anymore. I definitely recommend it.\n",

      "The lamp is very bright (as in don't look at the light bright) - which is good for it's intended use- I wanted a couple of these to be able to quickly grab when the power goes out at home. This is compact and very easy to use, and takes 3 AA batteries, which were included and installed.\n",

I HAD A FRIEND IN HAWAII THAT SENT ME 3 PACKETS OF THE OLD BHIP FLAVOR (THATS HOW I GOT HOOKED), WELL ITS BEEN BHIP SINCE THEN. I GAVE UP COFFEE AND REDBULL AND ALL CAFINEE DRINKS (YES YOU CAN TOO). I CHALLENGE YOU TO TAKE THE ONE MONTH CHALLENGE. IF AFTER A CONSISTENT MONTH ONCE A DAY YOU DON'T FEEL 100% MORE VIBRANT AND HEALTHIER BHIP WILL STAND BY THEIR GUARANTEE WHICH IS 100% SATISFACTION.

I TELL HER TO GET HER OWN BUT THEN REMEMBER THAT I AM MARRIED, : ( SO I DO SHARE MY BHIP! TRY IT YOU'LL LOVE IT, AND I FORGOT TO MENTION ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I EVEN GAVE IT A WHIRL WAS BECAUSE I HAD LOW BLOOD SUGAR AND COULDNT EVEN EAT WHITE BREADS AND PASTAS. I WAS SOOOO BAD THAT I WOULD FAINT NEARLY IF I DIDNT EAT EVERY 3 HOURS. HONEST TO GOD I NO LONGER HAVE THAT PROBLEM, MY WIFE IS A WITNESS TO THE MIRACLE! YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE MISSING. IF YOU ARE A BIG SODA DRINKER OR MONSTER/REDBULL DRINKER NOTE YOU WILL NEED TO GIVE IT SOME TIME FOR ADJUSTMENT IN TERMS OF TASTE, BUT REMEMBER YOUR BODY CRAVES WHAT IT IS USED TO BUT IF YOU STARVE IT OF THOSE SUGARS IT WILLL CRAVE WATER!!!

IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY, YOU ONLY GET 1 BODY AND THERE AREN'T RETURNS OR EXCHANGES FOR NEW BODYS, SO TREAT IT WELL AND IT WILL TREAT YOU EVEN BETTER!

      "I just lost my Samsung 46 inch top of the line when after only 3 years the picture developed a bad screen. Broke my heart but I realized even Samsung gets bad parts now and then. It's a good TV otherwise http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0071NWYP8  I take super care of my electronics as I kept this LCD in new condition right up to its death. Three years? I told the Samsung rep on the phone. He just said it was out of warranty, so long story short I decided against another Samsung.  The vizio rep happened to be there and he pointed out that they re-vamped all the smart apps and told me of the new back-lit 12 panel led zone, which even the 2013 high tech &#34;M&#34; series didn't have. After fiddling with the contrast and temp colors I was able to get a fantastic picture.Bought it, brought it home and set it up.Wow! I was pretty impressed to find a $700 TV that can go up against a $1500 TV. And then you toss in a referbished TV for $500 and you've got yourself a deal! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSG0AJO  Vizio also now has a smaller front frame edge measureing 10mm. only 2 mm less than last year but it makes for an almost invisable frame. Another bonus... I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0  I did a solid week of reading reviews and numerous visits to my local stores watching and adjusting several brands before deciding on a 55 inch LG or Vizio as my choices. I hated the new LG's magic remote( works like a mouse on the screen) but I also heard that the Vizio had lame apps on their smart E & the better M series.  Just last week I walked into my local &#34;S&#34; club and a guy was setting up the new 2014 E series B-2. He told me they were the first to get them.  Vizio ups the speaker wattage from 10 to 15 watts. Not mindblowing but way improved from the muffled speaker sound that is associated with most down pointed speakers that seems to be standard with most HGTV's. Bottom line I love it. Its good to see a company like Vizio upping their game with internal improvements instead of a cosmetic makeover like a lot of other companies.  Save some cash, get yourself a good as new TV! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSG0AJO\n",
      "The OXO Good Grips 3-in-1 Avocado Slicer, Green works very well as advertised.  It works well with this: http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B0088LR592/  The blade easily halves the avocado, making it equal to any sharp knife in the drawer. The pit remover is actually easier to use than a sharp knife - I've always slapped the knife blade into the seed & twisted, but then I have to pull the seed off the blade. I've never felt quite comfortable slamming a knife blade into the seed, or slicing the meat toward my hand -it goes against everything I was taught about cutting toward my skin with a sharp knife.   The Good Grips tool provides a much safer way to prepare avocados. I've owned several avocado slicers which had wire cutters, and the wires always sprung rending the tool useless. The slicing strips of the Good Grips slicer are sturdy plastic, cutting and scooping easily and cleanly through both large and small avocados.   On very ripe, soft avocado meat I've had to help the last little bit through the tool by pushing on the end of the avocado peel, but this is a minor thing. The tool fits comfortably in large or small hands; it certainly speeds up the preparation of avocados and is a clean way to prepare them; and it washes up easily.

      "Exactly what i was looking for and love the way it looks, easy set up,  and so far.it's working perfectly! Audio is very clear and connects to the phone right away when i turn on the car. I was able to find a station to sync it to and I haven't had to change the channel, even when driving an hour or to out of town.i also use this device to talk hands-free on my phone and also use it to connect to any Bluetooth-enabled device.  And  even i  use it to charge my phone or player while streaming audio.<br />If you spend a lot of time in your car, if you enjoy quality sound in your car, if you listen to audio books or your favorite music, then this transmitter is a must. I'm really amazed and will continue to use it happily when I travel.Really  overall great product. would recommended to every one\n",
      "Nice and thick serum formula, spreads and absorbs great. I love that this retinol serum is applied at night instead of in the morning since sun avoidance is recommended when doing any retinol treatment. So far it is working wonderfully!\n",

      "I wanted a very basic case for my new iPhone 5. I am not rough on phones and didn't want a bulky case.I didn't want a screen protector either because I have not been satisfied with the feel of any I have tried. This case is perfect for me. I was looking to have something easy and good. My iPhone looks very nice. It is so beautifully designed and protect my phone very well. I get a lot of comments on the high resolution print and the vivid color of this case.\n",
      "First of all, if you travel a lot and are looking for a lightweight and simple charger this is definitely the key. Even if you charge a lot of USB devices at home, these are still nice to have in every room.<br /><br />Qicent's Dual USB Wall Charger is a solid charger that plugs directly into the wall. It's a one piece charger and looks great plugged in. There are two ports with each having a different ampage. The top one is rated at 2.4A/5V and is designed for charging tablets and larger devices while the bottom one is rated at 1.5A/5V and is designed for charging smartphones and smaller devices.<br /><br />There is a blue indicator light that lets you know when the charger is plugged in correctly and pulling power. This is nice because sometimes I don't push my chargers in all the way, plus they are easy to see in the dark. Overall, its an excellent charger. This charger only includes the charger, there are no extra cables included. There is also a 24 month warranty that comes with this purchase so you know you are covered if you have any problems.\n",
      "I have been wanting to go to Thailand and Vietnam for a long time, so when these Lonely Planet books, [[ASIN:1741797144 Thailand]] and [[ASIN:1741797152 Vietnam]] became available I had to get them. Lonely Planet really gets into a country in their guides. The don't fill their pages with glossy color photos, though a few would be nice, instead their pages are full of information.<br /><br />They have maps to everywhere you'd want to go in a country. They do the cities justice as well as the countryside. They do the markets and the beaches, the churches and the museums, the bike trails and the footpaths.<br /><br />I believe a trip to Thailand should include a side tour to Vietnam, at least mine is going to, so both books are a necessity to me. The book on Thailand is over 800 pages and its writers write as if they've lived there, as if they really know the country. A different group of writers have written the Vietnam book and that surprised me, because I though some of them would have worked on both books. Nevertheless, though it's 250 pages shorter than the Thailand book, the book on Vietnam is equally as well written.<br /><br />I should say that the print in these books is on the smallish side, but I suppose to make it any larger they'd have to have so many pagers that the books would be unwieldy, especially the Thailand book.<br /><br />I've always looked at Lonely Planet as catering to a different kind of clientele than Frommor's or Fodor's. Those two companies seem to cater more toward the traveler who has more to spend, who will more than likely stay in the more expensive hotels. Sure you'll find the expensive hotels in Lonely Planet as well, but you'll find a myriad of less expensive alternatives. I believe you get more information about a country from Lonely Planet and I'm looking forward to going to Thailand and Vietnam and having Lonely Planet show me the way.\n",

      "We had a need for a device like this. And we tried some other products, each has some problems. This has everything we could ever ask for...<br />There should be no reason for anyone to give anything less than 5 stars BUT I believe Munchkin has a few bad production batches.. As a result, some people have received lemons...Their devices did not survive for more than a month.<br /><br />I think, you should go ahead and buy it. If you have any problems, Amazon is here to support..<br /><br />Not so great features:<br />- Sound quality is not crisp, but considering you are just listening to \"noise\" it does not matter...They had to keep the cost low..<br />- Hard to find the buttons in dark..<br /><br />Great Features:<br />- This has a projector that you can use on the wall or ceiling... You can even change slides, for different graphics....Monkeys are fun.<br /><br />- Different sounds available.. Most people would prefer white noise, but you have options..<br /><br />- There is a timer.. And also there is voice activation.. If there is any noise, white noise comes back..<br /><br />If this unit breaks down, I wouldn't hesitate to a new one..<br /><br />Update:<br />Still going strong. Dependable.\n",

It is also 100% organic and Kosher which is a big deal to me. It also contains a natural abundance of potassium and magnesium, as well as other electrolytes. For anyone skeptical of trying out Cocozia I highly recommend you do - this is the best out there.\n",

Its like heaven its like when you use it at the very top of your head and scalp it sends tingles down you spine, I know that sounds so weird, but it is a good therapeutic wonderful relaxing feeling each time the brush hits your scalp and head.  I have thick long hair, and part of that means I have to take extra effort to keep it healthy and par of that means a goo brush.  brushing when you have long hair is a must, it helps distribute the natural oils into ones hair and scalp. This is a good brush for doing that  I like how the brush is shaped and fits good into ones hands. Im glad I now have it among my hair tools.\n",

      "This is an amazing thermometer. We manage a Bed & Breakfast Inn. For a winter special we cook a 7-course Chef Tasting Menu. We use the Infrared Gun for testing our oil before adding the shrimp. A switch inside the battery compartment (9volt) allows you to switch off the laser sight, which will prolong battery life. My use does not require the aim of the laser so it is VERY nice. Seems quite accurate. We also test the temperatures throughout the Inn - especially near all doors to make sure our floors are at an appropriate and comfortable temperature for our guests. Highly recommended!\n",

      "After reading every router review on Amazon... I came to the conclusion that I just needed a simple router for my iPad and iPhone to connect with. All other devices in the home are CAT6. I plugged this device in and looked on the bottom for the router IP, Login and Password and within 5 minutes I have it configured and by using the same name and password for wireless from my old router the Apple products did not know the difference. The range covers the whole house and outside and I could not be happier. Even if this unit dies within 6 months it is still cheaper than other big name brands.\n",

I was a little iffy about a mixed product at first, but it holds up really well! The coarseness is just fine enough but not too fine that it's a powder. The quality is strong and sturdy and should hold up for a while to come. I really like this little guy and will be recommending it to friends.\n",
      "I have recently started using mud masks. They were recommended to me by a skin care expert. I love this one. Some mud masks are so specific in what they'll do.

      "This tablet is a little expensive. But the deal is extremely worthy because this tablet is packed with many useful and upgraded features. First thing is the extra-large display. It is 10\" and better than an ordinary 7\" display. Front camera is 8MP. Pictures and videos are excellent and video calls are so clear and HD. To support this feature, this tablet PC is 4G enabled. 4G is better speed than a 3G connectivity. 4G transfers data extremely faster. Processor is also high speed and dual core. Graphic card also performs faster and support many high level 3D games.  This tablet also uses one of the advanced batteries as the primary energy source. It can keep the tab alive for long long hours. Hrd disk is 16GB. Is 16GB enough? Well if you are a downloader and a movie lover that capacity is not even nearly enough. Alternative is a expanding of memory using a micro SD memory card. I use [[ASIN:B00D1FXX96 New 32gb Micro Sd Card Sdhc Tf Flash Memory Card 32gb Class 10, New! Usa!]]. It is my favourite because it is trouble less and reliable.\n",
      "I bought two of these at Christmas for my 7 yr old son and 8 yr old daughter. I followed the directions, carefully charging them all the way up, discharging all the way down, several times, while loading a bunch of games, music apps, and wall paper onto each of them. I put a screen protectors on them and bought a TabSuit leather cases for protection. The gaming is impressive, due to the internal gyroscope/accelerometer, one can play Angry Birds GO! as well as Driving games, by steering/turning the tablet. The sound is about what you'd expect from a small device, but with ear phones is great. With heavy graphics & gaming, the battery lasts about 3-4 hours, and on stand-by or with music, the battery lasts days. No problems with Wi Fi, no problems with the display. The tablet has been working perfectly for a month with near daily use.\n",

      "This stevia product is the real deal, not like other products with a label that says 100% Stevia and then turns out to be \"cut\" with a non-nutrient... like the product I recently bought at Whole Foods. (Check the ingredients label, not just the front.)    Nature's Candy brand stevia also avoids the metallic tastes of other brands. I buy the 1 pound bag and decant into smaller shakers. Shakers work because it doesn't attract moisture, so doesn't have to be firmly capped.\n",

No one even hears them anymore because they are just like radio static or white noise. Eventually, you hear something so much that you just stop paying any attention to it. I have tried to tell him that he needs to change things up, maybe use some Facebook ads or maybe set up a Twitter account. He will not listen.

      "I tried one of these at my friend's house and was pleasantly surprised how well it works. Theirs was made in Japan and they had to hire someone to install. The BIDET4ME E-300Al was very simple to install. Also the shape of this model was aesthetically pleasing to the eye compared to their model which is used in nursing homes. It appeared thinner and sleeker.<br /><br />Very Easy to controls and use. Setting on warm temperature, and width of stream very convenient. I opted for the model over the 350 because I wanted the dryer function, which works well enough, but I find myself sitting up before the dryer time is up and using paper.<br /><br />This is very worthwhile purchase. I almost can't live without it.  =)\n",

      "The collar works great! Our English Bully used to bark at everything! She suffered from separation anxiety. She was fine while we were home with her, however I had my neighbors complaining that she barked non-stop while we were at work. Purchased this collar and problem solved! It only took her a few days of wearing it for a few hours a day. She still barks but nowhere near the amount she used to. And, best of all, my neighbors are now happy! They said they can't hear her barking anymore when we aren't home! Amazing product at an awesome cheap price !\n",
      "Fits perfectly with my  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B006Z2BZBU  We had some thicker flannel ones but I wanted to get some lighter cotton ones for the warmer months and to take to daycare for DD's cot, and these are perfect. They are very soft and lightweight. I purchased the mint and the pink geometic dots. I will definitely be purchasing more in the near future!  I was unsure about buying these because we've tried other brands of crib sheets that do not fit DD's mattress, even though its a standard size. I decided to try them because the price was low enough to where I wouldn't be upset if they ended up not fitting after all. Luckily these do fit perfectly even after washing and drying several times.  ---------  After using these sheets for several months now I've decided to come back and review again.  In all those washings the colors on these have not faded, there are no holes, and the elastic is still working great. The same cannot be said of the other brands of sheets we have tried which we have purchased from both Babies R Us and Target. I will definitely be buying more!  These sheets are great! I change my daughter's sheets two or three times a week on average, and I only have 5 sheets that fit her bed, so they get washed A LOT.\n",

A lot of people live in my household at the moment so washing the dishes is a nightmare!!!! My hands feel tender, disgusting, cracked and pained after 30 minutes of hot, scalding, soapy water torture, haha. So when it's my day to wash the dishes, I set this right next to the sink, and instant relief.\n",

I have several same brand of oils and glycerin, they are all in 16oz bottles, the labels are exactly the same except the product names, even the font styles are the same, so it is difficult to tell which one is which when I put them all together on the shelf. I suggest the different-looking labels (different colors, pictures, and font styles) for different oils, such as almond oil, jojoba oil, vegetable glycerin, etc. Right now, they all look the same, which is confusing.\n",
      "I got so tired of spending an exorbitant amount of money on toner cartridge.

We were not sure if this whistle could work but we went for it since it was being offered at a fair price compared to the other brands.

It's more valuable.\n",

I get some on my hands and rub it through her hair. Then, I get some more on my hands and and twist small sections of her hair around my fingers to bring out the curls. Then, I scrunch her hair from the bottom for even more curl. It is so much fun. She loves having her hair fussed over.

      "I have an older vehicle which I often drive slowly. (In parades, off road, and on the beach) My mechanical clutch-fan isn't always able to keep up because of the low RPMs and the lack of air flow.

It's a great book to read when your in your early high school years so that you can learn some valuable lessons from the characters in the book. Maybe if you don't want to listen to your parents experiences you'll listen to what these characters go through trying to get around the popularity contests, boyfriend stealers, and fake friends. This book has a lot of ups and downs leaving the reader wondering if it will be a happy ending or one of those books that like to go by “Reality”. Not to give spoilers, but I hate the endings that don't match the ending that I wanted while reading.\n",

      "With this product, it came in a large round jar. Upon opening it the first thing that hit me was the aroma. It has a menthol kind of smell to it that I think is amazing. When applied, it has a cool sensation that feels nice and the gel-cream is neither too thick or too think, it has a perfect consistency that smooths on nicely. I like the way it feels going onto my skin and how quickly it absorbs. I hate getting creams, lotions, make-up, deodorant or anything like that on my clothes when getting dressed. I have been using the body merry line for about a week and a half and this cellulite gel-cream seems to be working well. I am not rid of all my bumps and lumps yet, but they do seem to be fading a little everyday.\n",

I highly recommend this book for its clarity, its comprehensiveness, and its message of personal and spiritual growth.\n",

In terms of reviewing material for exam it has everything you need and more. I would say that a few days is not enough to go thoroughly through all of it, so allow yourself a bit more time and Good Luck!\n",
      "Need to find a good set of flashcards? Look no further. The authors of this set took the time ti really summarize and explain the material so even though it's more condensed you get the same level of understanding you would from a traditional guide - I'd argue even clearer understanding. And the best part about them is if you want to study on your commute there's no extra weight to carry because the cards are relatively small and virtually weightless.\n",
      "The cover of this book drew me in first, and reading about the book thoroughly intrigued me. It is really adventurous read, neat. But I was wrong in my assumptions.

      "We purchased one of these to take care of our hell-spawn (raccoon) problem. The coons were digging up the yard, eating new plants, and searching for grubs.

No more eviscerated plants, no more dirt piles, no more coons! Its expensive, but worth it.<br /><br />The crow even works on dumb humans, like me! =-) I came home late at night from the movies and found quite a surprise when my sister turned this thing on forgetting I was still out. The scarecrow got me. Repeatedly. And I deserved it.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't forget to turn it off or the UPS man won't like you very much.<br /><br />Awesome. Worth every penny.\n",

      "This is a great alarm system that helps me keep my family safe. The Senors are really good quality and they WILL detect even the slightest movement. The system is relatively easy to set up and use. No wiring is necessary as all window and door contacts, motion detectors and key fobs are remote. The main panel can handle more units and sensors than would be needed in an average size house. Depending on the product you order determines how many window and door contacts, motion detectors and key fobs and other devices such as fire detectors and sirens are supplied.\n",
      "This is a great loofah! The long straps make it very convenient to reach the back and shoulders without being awkward and uncomfortable. I got one for myself and even the husband using it, The natural material has been great for exfoliating with just enough scrub.<br />I have used other loofah's and scrubbers where I have felt they weren't doing anything or were just too abrasive. Maintenance on this loofah has been easy. Simply rinse, wring out, air dry. Very easy to use, and last for a long time. I have enjoyed this loofah so far, and definitely will keep on using it. I would  highly recommend it to anyone.\n",

      "The batteries arrived as advertised completely pre-charged. They replaced Energizers (model NH15BP4) that couldn't hold a charge for more than a day (which is standard for Energizer rechargeables... just read the reviews).<br /><br />However, these Amazon batteries caused our Canon SX110 digital camera to malfunction. The lens would not autofocus. I searched online and read digital cameras can be picky about batteries. We tried other batteries in the camera later that day and it worked perfectly. I checked the Amazon batteries on a La Crosse Technology BC-700, which I highly recommend, and they were fine. I'm chalking it up to the Canon is just picky. Aside from that one hiccup, these batteries are amazing when it comes to holding a charge.<br /><br />I'm using them primarily in my Uniden scanner and they work great.<br /><br />I'll try to update this review in the future.\n",

      "Best face moisturizer I've been able to find so far. Makes my skin baby butt smooth, has helped clear up any minor breakouts I've had and most importantly, didn't break me out or make me oily. Don't bother wasting money on the expensive department store type marula oil. They are chock full of chemicals and silicone( this is what makes you're skin feel smooth in those products, and also clogs the crap out of your pores) this oil is very light, doesn't have an unpleasant odor like some other oils I've used (hemp seed oil works great but smells hideous) and in a pinch one pump will moisturize your hands like they have never been moisturized before. Seriously cannot say enough good things about this product.\n",
      "I had doubts ordering for this product because i had series of similar product experience and it did nothing to my dog. All my dog could do was bark more and more. I had to give this a trial and it did pay off. I now have enough rest trying to control my dogs barking and disturbance.<br />Honestly it has really helped me and am glad i did.<br /><br />To all dog owners out there, this is the best product from other similar ones except you have a contrary opinion. But as for me, i love this product\n",

Your animal needs the best<br />care out there and you're prepared for any situation with this complete kit.\n",
      "Having spent hours in the stores searching for a wooden cross, but most of them were either too cheaply crafted or were too expensive. But finally, I have found the cross I was looking for. I came across this during my search ordered it right away when I saw the picture of the cross. It arrived safely, well packed and my reaction on opening the box was joyful! This is far better quality wise then the expensive ones I had left behind. The gorgeous finishing on the wood feels almost too good to be true. I keep this one very close to my under my pillow and pray to it every night before going to bed.\n",

      "After using this back shaver for some time now I decided to give a great demonstration on how the shaver works.  The baKblade is definitely set apart from the other back shavers for multiple reason.  First, the baKblade has a larger blade that covers so much ground when shaving you are literally done in less than a minute.  The shave actually feels great and because of the way the shaving blades are arranged it's impossible to cut your back when using the shaver.  Also, there is no need for shaving cream when dry shaving as you can see from the video the shaver doesn't take much effort to actually get the job done either.  I have recommended this shaver to many friends and family and no one has every had a negative thing to say about it.  Also, the handle is very lightweight and has an ergonomic curve to it that allows the user to reach the \"hard to reach\" areas.  Another feature of this shaver that is a huge benefit is the fact that it actually tackles longer hairs too so if you are shaving your back for the first time there's no need to use a hair trimmer or electric trimmer to trim away first.  The blade surprisingly works under any circumstance. Take a look at my video and please vote \"yes\" if you feel this video was helpful to you.\n",

What I really like about it the most is using it in my hair. I think it is important to know because of my hair type I am asian and my hair is long just past my waist. I am fanatical about having healthy hair even at the very bottom where as we all know is dead hair. Every time I wash my hair I apply the Argan Oil and I either blow dry it or let it air dry. Either way the oil absorbs beautifully into the cuticles of each strand. Having used this my hair is so much softer, silky and shinier!!\n",

      "I have used this tool for several years now. I love this impact wrench. It is my favorite tool. It is not strong enough to brake truck lug nuts but I thats OK. That's not what this tool is for. I am a ford licenced mechanic and I use it every day for heavy mechanic work. Sometimes I have to brake the nuts and bolts with a breaker bar (like 5% of the time) but then I use this tool to take the nut or bolt out. Sometimes we mechanics encounter long bolts that would take 3 to 5+ minutes to take out with a regular ratchet. Imagine taking the transmission out from a ford explorer. It has 12 long bolts and like 18 medium bolts. Once they are all broken with the breaker bar is a matter of SECONDS to take those 12 bolts out. Normally I cut work time to a half or less using this tool. It has enough torque to help me with the 95% of the job. Deffinetely love this impact wrench. Mine is all dirty from mechanic work, looks like a Dalmatian (black grease spots) but it still going strong...\n",

      "My son Loves it<br />I was looking for a stroller for my 2.5 year old boy, because he started making me crazy that he wants to move around his plush animals in a stroller like my 4 YR old daughter. I didn't believe that I would ever find a blue doll stroller, until I looked on Amazon.com and found this stroller. I loved it so much that I bought it in blue and pink.<br />Let me share some of the pros and cons of this product; the quality is decent for the price you pay-it is not going to last for years,but it will last for about 6  months to 1 year. But on the other hand it's not expensive, the fabric is really strong and nice,  and the swiveling wheels is a plus. Any time the stroller is in my way, I just fold it up and it packs small for easy storage. I also like that the seat belt is not a buckle - it is just 1 piece to slide the doll in & out.<br /><br />Over all this is a very decent stroller for this price.\n",

      "I'm not much of a barbecue lover, but when I do want some barbecue taste, I want real taste and not some injected stuff. So, I decided to try these wood chips primarily because I love Mesquite flavored barbecue potato chips, and I wanted my chicken to have a good taste.  I must admit, these chips really pack some smoke power.  It really doesn't take that many chips to give your meat some awesome smoke flavor and taste, and you will also love the color it gives your meat after you are done cooking.  It gives it that nice deep red smokey look that I really like to see when I eat barbecue chicken.  The meat had such a great taste to the point where I really didn't have to use all that much barbecue sauce!  I'm loving how long these chips last, and I'm buying some more now so I won't have to run out.  I really think you'll love these if you want your smoked meat to have a great taste.  My next experiment is salmon!\n",

      "I enjoy using looms myself. I'm in my 30s and I truly have a good time creating looms accessories.  Of course I go for more advanced and complicated design.  I fill orders for some organizations and make a little money on the side. But i really just enjoy making accessories.<br /><br />Infinity looms is not a well advertised brand but it really should be out there on the tv and magazines.  I find the quality of the bands to be really good. The bands have bright colors, and you get a  lot of colors in the deluxe kit.  The bands are soft, odorless, the have a good stretch which makes it easier for me to do complex designs.  The hooks are alright.  I do prefer s-clips over c-clips.  The loom itself is really good.  It's sturdy and not flimsy.  You can extend the looms to any length just keep attaching more looms.<br /><br />As far as i'm concerned with the many brands I've tried for looms, Inifity loom bands are on top.  Please try it out yourself and I'm sure you will also notice the difference.\n",
      "I would recommend this book to parents, teachers and especially Autistic kids, no matter where they are on the spectrum. Luke not only provides invaluable insight into how AS affects his life, but how Autism affects the lives of his two younger brothers. He also provides helpful, bullet point, lists on how to manage everything from sleeping, homework and even dating.<br /><br />The title is quite apt, because this is truly a guide to handling many of the challenges teens with Autism face on a daily basis.<br /><br />Additionally, I would recommend this book to any authors attempting to write fictional stories featuring Autistic characters. Luke breaks down a lot of stereotypes prevalent in pop culture today.<br /><br />He is witty, optimistic and has a great deal insightful in to human social behavior. His sense of humor is charming and very relatable. I personally found his unique perspective on the subtly of language and contradictions in social expectations to be enlightening.<br /><br />This book a fun, informative read.

The flavor is great and the feelings of relief are wonderful after a long, hard day of work.<br /><br />My greatest feeling comes when I add 5-htp and melatonin ([[ASIN:B00CBE7IDU Melatonin 5 mg - 180 Capsules + FREE 5-HTP 100 mg - 60 Capsules]]) to the tea though; talk about an overwhelming calm! All the stress from my day is immediately wiped away when I use this blend! The flavor of the yogi and power mixed with those supplements gives me the ultimate rush of content. I feel so balanced when I have a glass of tea using those that it's almost intoxicating. The feelings are so hard to put into words.<br /><br />A bag of the tea is the perfect amount of flavor for my glass, with a little of each powder it's like a calm bliss. None of the day's baggage seems relevant anymore. I love that feeling. My mood is instantly improved and I am able to sleep soundly knowing I have the stress off my shoulders for the time being. It's a great way to enhance your overall well being. I suggest the blend to any natural tea lover like me!\n",

      "This reverse love story of Shakespeare's most famous play tells the story of Julio and his beloved Romiette. They meet in an online chatroom and find out they go to the same high school. When a local gang, &#34;The Family,&#34; A.K.A. The Devildogs, find out Romiette and Julio are dating, they don't approve. Romiette and Julio try to ignore them, but the Devildogs take things too far.<br />  This book was amazingly written. I can't really think of anything else to describe it. It wasn't too sappy and it wasn't too violent. Beautiful love story and amazingly written. Enough said.\n",
      "this kit made installation pretty simple and was a decent price.  I liked the plug and play design, it saves TONS of time when installing these parts.  Contactor itself is very heavy duty and is built to last.  The switch is nice and compact, but easy to operate.\n",

The only thing the basic microsoft keyboard has over this is it has the &#34;calculator&#34; button, which would really be cool to have on this. But really, there was nothing wrong with the way keyboards were before, and there's nothing wrong with this one now. I love this keyboard, right out of the box.\n",

      "I was hesitant to try this trackball mouse after reading some of the reviews but I'm glad I bought it. I'm at a computer all day so I need some mousing variety to give my arm a rest. This trackball mouse filled that bill. It takes a bit to get used to but it works just fine. The construction quality is on par with other computer mice/trackballs I've owned (Logitech, Microsoft, Dell). It tracks just fine and all buttons work. I would recommend it to anyone needing an alternative.\n",
      "I started eating Manuka honey a couple of years ago when I was on a trip over to New Zealand. There were a lot of cool little honey shops spread throughout the country so I ended up tasting a lot of different regional honeys. Happy Valley was one of the honey shops that we stopped into. Most of the honeys we tried down there tasted pretty amazing and were full of health benefits.  We bought some of this and the Wildflower blend recently and they are just like the honeys I had when I was traveling over there.  It is really cool to see that I can get this without having to go all the way down to New Zealand. This is  beautiful mild honey and I put it anything, so not overpowering - a real clean taste.\n",

      "&#34;Vine Customer Review of Free Product (What's this?)<br /><br />My friend has one of these:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B003LSTD38<br /><br />We all have external portable hard drives. Most of us have several of them. Like rabbits, they seem to multiply over time. And they get larger--much larger. What was 250 GB the day before yesterday was 500 GB yesterday and a terabyte today. The more they hold, the more we stand to lose if they are dropped and the data is not backed up elsewhere.<br /><br />Sadly, the portable drives that carry around our prized possessions (photos, music, videos, data files, etc.) often go unprotected. (True, some portable hard drives come with cases of sorts--but, really, how good is their protection?) And consider how many portable drives we purchase that come with no case at all. Nothing to protect that which is protecting our valuable data. How can this be allowed?<br /><br />Apparently, the folks at Amazon have recognized this shortcoming and have offered us a solution in the AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Case for My Passport Essential. The case feels rugged enough and while it doesn't offer a great deal of padding, the webbing and elastic drive strap inside may help in the event of a few minors falls. The case has a stiff outer shell that may provide some additional protection. Most importantly, you have something to keep your portable drive housed in while it is not in use.<br /><br />Although they do vary a bit in size and shape, most modern portable drives seem close to being the same form factor. That led me to wonder why Amazon singled out the Passport Essential Drive for this case. Was it some cross advertising deal with Western Digital? Was it that they plan to offer an entire line of AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Cases each intended for a specific manufacture's model? So, in the interest of science, I conducted an experiment to see what other portable drives might fit in this case. I gathered my portable drives togetherand tried each one individually in the carrying case that I had received. Here are my results:<br /><br />* Maxtor 320 GB (very old drive) - Too large to fit<br />* OWC Mercury 250 GB - Too large to fit (besides it comes with its own leather case)<br />* Seagate Expansion 500 GB- Too long to fit<br />* Seagate FreeAgent Go 640 GB - Too large to fit (besides it comes with its own case)<br />* WD Elements Portable SE 320 GB - It fits, but it is a very tight squeeze<br />* Toshiba 640 GB - Fits perfectly<br />* WD My Passport 500 GB - Fits and actually is a bit small for the case<br />* WD My Passort Essential 1 TB - Fits perfectly (as was expected)<br />* WD My Passport Studio 500 GB - Too large to fit<br />* Apple iPhone 3GS - Fits perfectly (it's not a hard drive, but I just had to give the iPhone a try)<br /><br />(* No drives were intentionally harmed during this testing.)&#34;\n",

      "This is a very well made garlic press. It is strong & dependable & works so easily. You don't have to be super strong to use it. I have arthritis in my hands and can't always squeeze things, but this so well made even I can do it.

      "My Mac started to lose its letters on its keys and I got them changed by apple, saw this and thought I would give it a try, if you are thinking about protecting your keyboard this s a must. The silicone us so thin it just stays in place over your keyboard, it doesn't slip or move around and there is no strain on the hinge when you close the laptop. I was so impressed I bought a second cover and three of my friends also purchased when they saw it too.\n",

      "I am a passionate motocyclist for many years. And in this time I tried a lot of balaclavas. But most of them were just of a bad quality. Either the fabrics was tearing apart, or it was worn out after a few uses or it was just itchy to my scalp.<br /><br />But not with these balaclavas. It feels very good on my skin (absolutely no itching) and it also saves of from the wind that goes under my helmet. It fits on my big head (helmet size XXL) and also on my wifes head that is much smaller than mine (S)<br />Alltogether these balaclavas are in a high quality that all the motocycle gear should be.\n",
      "My husband and I use Quickbooks for our small business and I'm fairly good at it. By that I mean that I can enter what I'm supposed to enter where I'm supposed to enter it so that at the end of the year our accountant can make sense of it all, but I've never really understood accounting. I was taught how to use the program and I just do it.<br /><br />However, now that I've got this book I'm beginning to understand just what it is that I've been doing. This book starts off simple than moves you into the more difficult aspects of accounting. It's written so anybody can understand it and it's not boring at all. If you want to get started in accounting, this book for dummies (hey, I'm no dummy) will really help you.\n",
      "These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00E9262IE  But they are the best I've heard in the sub $100 price range. Possibly comparable to these Sennheisers Earbuds http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B001EZYMF4  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00T56GFTA  Pros + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode and not stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00T56GFTA  I hope this review was helpful!\n",

      "I have been a long time customer of Todd's Seeds and these organic alfalfa seeds are right up there with the organic broccoli seeds they sell. First, it's amazing how many seeds come in the one pound bag. Second, it's really amazing how many sprouts you can get out of just a few tablespoons of seed!<br /><br />Most people do not realize that because they are so small, the alfalfa sprouts contain a concentrated amount of certain vitamins and minerals such as calcium, vitamin K and vitamin C. Alfalfa sprouts contain just 8 calories and 0 grams of fat per cup. We eat these alone, and on our sandwiches. We like the Todd's Seeds brand because he sent us a copy of the laboratory testing they do to verify no pathogens, ecoli, etc. You need good seeds to get good sprouts!\n",
      "Trained my puppy with it for a few weeks. He learned very quickly! After several months, we took him camping for the first time and I used the collar again and just used the vibrate mode and he was perfectly behaved! Works great and has made a dramatic improvement in my dog's behavior.\n",

      "In the past few years, I don't know what happened to my dog. He used to be such a friendly little pup, always listening to me and everyone, but suddenly everything changed and he became a devil. He started howling and barking all night long for absolutely no reason at all. He bit my daughter when she tried to play with him, and it doesn't stop here. Whenever he gets a chance he bites, nips and jumps at people. We have given him a room in our house, but he totally ruined it with filth.<br /><br />Me and my wife were looking for some dog training device to control our dog as he was getting aggressive day by day. He runs into the kitchen and into everything he sees. He was out of control so much that I would have killed him or gave him to someone else if I wouldn't have got my hands on this dog training shock collar with vibration. It worked perfectly as I had to use different levels of shock for my dog. I never used a dog collar before, but it certainly is a valuable product for dog owners.<br /><br />After using the collar on my dog, I am shocked and happy to see him back in his decent and obedient self again. I recommend this device to all the dog owners out there.\n",

Does work great to cover smoke smell a bit from others walking in my door, I have many family members that do not like to smell cigarettes and have complimented since started using these! I would say as far as burn time average to most incense sticks but overall wonderful scents!! I also love these as are great to sit and relax to them is great tension reliever!!\n",

      "it did work great for my hp Pavilion dv5-1160us.this battery is a longer life model and is larger than the standard model. It creates a &#34;bump&#34; along the back on the bottom of the laptop but I like it because it raises the back about 1/2 inch and I think this helps with cooling since air can get underneath the machine. Plus the laptop is slightly slanting towards you just like many desktop keyboards that have the little flip down tabs to raise the back of the keyboard a little bit. It's a bit heavier than the OEM but I don't find that to be any problem.\n",

      "My 13-year-old son hates folding laundry and would get really irritated when he had to fold t-shirt and couldn't get them folded right. This has made folding laundry for a 13-year-old MUCH easier!!!

Little did I know he would be using it weekly! AWESOME!!!\n",
      "It is beginning to be summer time, and we all know what that means! Flies and mosquitos. They are very annoying all summer long especially while you are trying to enjoy the outside. The flies are already out this year and I needed something to get rid of them. I was offered this at a promotional rate and I jumped at the chance because my last fly swatter broke last year. The problem I have a lot of the time in getting fly swatters is that they are too flimsy and make it where you cant benefit from it. These were very strong and killed flies very easily. I think these will be long lasting.\n",

      "I recently purchased this box on Amazon and I have been truly impressed. I have owned several other android tv boxes as well as a raspberry pi 2 so I am not a novice with them. My hats off to the folks at Vilso for  not only putting out a quality product but also going the distance to be one of the first to offer sound support as well as loaded with all the things needed to make it the best box on the market bar none I have ever used. The box boots up lightening fast and everything flows smoothly as it should. Having the extra GB of memory makes a huge difference. xbmc works better on this box than any of the others I have used. The repos installed have everything one could wish for. I've used this for nearly a month now of hard use and have yet to have the first issue with it. The only thing I could wish for is a better design in the factory remotes but now its coming together with an additional air mouse remote control that makes it much better I'm a happy camper.\n",

My son says gummy Legos are next!<br />This is a must have for any Lego fan!\n",

      "I have never worked for a company large enough to have an HR Department and in the few small business that I've run in my life, I didn't have one, but then I've never had more than three employees to deal with and when they didn't like how things were going, they told me directly.<br /><br />However, if you work for a large company and want to advance, this might be a good book for you. If you're in the HR department of such a company it should probably be required reading. This book explains the value of employees to a company and thus the HR department. Money spent on HR is not money down the drain, but money well spent the author argues and from what I've read of his book, he's probably right.\n",

      "This is an excellent kettlebell with excellent price, it totaled less than most good quality kettlebells run before shipping is even added-on. It has a shiny black coat and is very smooth. The handle is larger in comparison to the other kettlebells I own--I have 2 GoFit and 1 Body Solid. It is both larger around the circumference of the handle itself, AND there is a larger space in the area between the handle and top of the bell. This works out well for me, I can get a better grip with a single hand because of the thicker width.\n",

It creates a neat little folded package that takes up less space in my shirt cabinet than folding by hand. I can fit more folded shirts in the same amount of space. And it's easier to find a particular t-shirt when I'm looking for one. An necessary tool to use in the laundry room. I highly recommend this shirt folding board to anyone who wants to streamline their laundry process.\n",

      "This mount is a beast and that's just what I needed for my huge display. I have a 90 some pound 70 inch and this mount holds it like its nothing. Now the mount is heavy and big itself so I guess that can be a draw back, but it has to be if your trying to get it to hold screens of this size and weight. It was pretty easy to install with a friend I would not recommend doing it alone it is a two man job. Once the we had it up and got my heavy tv on it everything held and didn't budge. When it came to moving it one of the joints were a little stiff just enough to bug me, I was able to adjust the swivel tension screw and fixed it with ease. This mount moves with ease as I change up the direction my display is facing all depends on where I am sitting or at in my room. But I can see the screen from a prefect angle wherever I wanted to be. I really have nothing bad to say about this mount just something's I pointed out. like I said you will need someone to help you because its heavy but other than that its smooth sailing. make sure your screwed into your studs! Great mount able to handle a large tv set with no problem.\n",

And the accessories pockets and holding belt makes it easy to arrange devices, cables and accessories, etc. It's also good quality and compact enough to be a light-weight addition to his bag. The waterproof material is good for him too because he always complained the rain showers ruined his important date and stuffs!

      "The size of the infuser is perfect for a 4 cup pot of tea.<br /><br />The small straining holes allow for using some of the finest tea leaves.  I have found that other infusers allow for the leaves to escape and float in the tea-pot, requiring additional straining prior to serving.  This stainless steel product  is high quality and easy to clean.  The silicon handle and lid are well constructed and securely attach to the infuser. The product comes with a drip tray that could also be used to cover a tea-cup for warmth.<br /><br />It was a joy to use this product this past week.  Instead of jumping up to my hot-pot every 15 minutes, I simply prepare my water, make a pot of tea and continue with my computer work.\n",

It comes with a crane stand so you don't need<br />a tripod for it. When the crane stand was raised up I was able to reach 16' high. The movement of the crane is incredibly smooth and there is a large range of motion.<br />The monitor is good for framing your shot and seeing what your shooting. It is not a monitor for color correction or focus pulling. Comes with a bag for transporting.\n",

      "This is the best and my most favourite book ever! Dawn has done a beautiful job laying out the three texts side by side so you can easily cross reference them. Compared to the rather extortionate price of other Targums, Tsiyon Edition Targum Isaiah is very reasonably priced and worth every penny. The text itself really highlights the divinity of our Messiah and the overarching story of the Remnant of Israel which must return to the land. Every time I read this book I glean something new! Plus, the cover has a wonderful velvety feel to it, super important if you are a lover of books :)\n",

I love it.\n",

I can't recommend their strings highly enough.\n",

      "Good book. Interesting stories of the experiences of PayPal founder Peter Thiel. Interesting discussion about what it takes to make really innovative, prosperous companies with what Thiel describes as monopolies. His definition of monopoly is a company that creates something really new and innovative, not a company that has secured legal protection of some sort. Thiel says to create a blowout start up, one must create something really new, not just copy someone else's success. The next Zuckerberg will not create a social networking site. The next Gates will not create an operating system. They will create a new product that will launch a whole new category of product and they will continue to innovate and be productive for years and hold onto their monopoly status by bringing something new to the table, not just rehashing old ideas or products\n",
      "I just got these a few days ago and have not stopped using them, really impressed with the overall product. The features are really excellent, you can walk around the house doing laundry, vacuuming and cleaning while enjoying music (I usually stream Pandora or my Apple radio app) and the sound quality is loud and very nice. What I love most about this is when someone calls you, you can hear your phone ringing without knowing where your phone is to answer the call - just press the button on the side and boom you're talking to whoever called you. That's surely amazing and I haven't seen a feature like this. The other party just does not know I am on a headset and they are impressed every time I tell them. The range is also very good I can go around 30 feet and no loss of signal and quality. The headphone looks great, I love the black and red design, the buttons feel great and the pads are soooo soft wow. I can definitely say without thinking twice that this is an excellent little headset with some cool technology.\n",

      "I don't throw around words like brilliant very often, but this debut novel is it. I kept asking myself...how does he do it? This gentleman bravely chose to write in the first person a woman's life from childhood to older age. She experiences everything from an alcoholic mother, to a husband with early onset Alzheimer's disease. This was amazing in its depth and insight. Nothing about this book was easy material, and he wrote it with such delicacy. Sad topics like Alzheimer's can come off overwrought, but not here; he dealt with it with dignity and humanity. The most impressive thing was his ability to be so immersed in the female mind as the main character. I feel like authors spend entire careers trying to do what he accomplished in his first novel. I hope he keeps writing, because I will be a reader of his for many years to come\n",

The assembly was quick and easy as I following the included instructions. It took me less that 10 minutes to put the whole thing together.  The attention to detail is what I am pleased with.

I am using this in a bathroom but it can be used in any room.\n",

The kids love them and I must admit I do to.<br /><br />I really appreciate that these take recycling and helping save our environment to the next level.<br />No more buying paper liners and throwing them away. You can buy one set or more, depending on how many you need to make, and reuse. Time and time again. Just wash and reuse. I have several sets myself and use them regularly.<br />The silicone helps the liners heat evenly, no more burnt edges or bottoms.\n",
      "&#34;You really have to spend a lot more coin to get better performance than what this uniquely delivers and the percentage better is extremely minimal for the large jump in price. Personally I didn’t think it’s worth the extra price you’d have to pay for such a minimal upgrade. I mean look for yourself, check the reviews, price shop, comparison shop, but you’ll probably agree with me in the end.<br /><br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00U5INHSE<br /><br />This is not perfect, but for me it is about as close as it gets. I am a big fan and it suits my needs well.<br /><br />PROS<br />Build Quality, is really well done. Everything seems sturdy and good. My friends have commented on it's high build quality<br />It's a really good size<br />Price. One really can't complain for something this price and such good build quality.<br />Appearance.

Right from the start I couldn't believe how much matted fur this removed, easily and painlessly! It took several sessions over a period of a week or two, due to the severity of the matts, but my cat is now back to normal and I am so grateful, if this hadn't worked I was at the stage of resorting to having my vet shave him! I can't recommend this product highly enough. Don't waste time and stress trying anything else this is a miracle product\n",
      "Best price I found for this was on Amazon.  it comes with some basic instructions so do not purchase a book until you look at what it already has.

I've tried beyerdynamic, beats and sennheiser and they are equally good, but like the beyer i just find ridiculously expensive and yet sounds thesame as the m50. You can hear everything, midrange and bass is just fantastic. I spent quite a fortune on these but having tried those that were half a grand I feel like I snatched this one right out of the store.\n",
      "Wow! Personally, I think this is one book that will be enjoyed by everyone no matter your age is. If you are an animal lover, it will be a perfect read for you. I love all the characters here especially Boris, Olga, Charlie and Gus. They are all very different from one another but that's what made this story more interesting. It has a lot of moral lessons to tell so, I think it'll be a really great read for kids. It shows how wonderful love is between humans and animals. Also, it gives the feeling of hope. No matter how tragic your life had become, it'll be change one day just like what happened to Boris and Olga. They both had a terrifying past but sooner or later, they found a loving family that gives them all the love and caring that they need and they are also able to experience lots of exciting adventures that they really enjoy. After reading this book, I feel more inspired to love animals more. It made me want to have a real life Boris, Olga, Charlie and Gus to take care of. It really is a great book.

I can't stress enough how great the customer service has been between the seller and Amazon. You guys rock! The case itself is extremely well made. The front cover is thin (in a GOOD way) and the back portion fits the Galaxy tab pro 8.4 tablet like a glove! The magnets used are strong and hold very well. The front and back are a sort of leathery material while the undersides of the front and back are a soft touch material (sort of a soft felt). The two viewing angles available are perfect for using in your lap or on a desk. The magnet on the back of the case to keep the front cover folded back was a nice touch as well. I don‘t often write reviews but this one is well deserved,  Thanks Gambolex and thanks Amazon! 5 stars for sure!\n",

      "Great item. I use it to protect an ipad mini from a 6yr old. Very durable, excellent drop protection, very useful \"handle\" that folds back to provide tilt when used on a lap or desk, also props up like a mini lcd for watching movies etc. My only concern is the handle may pull apart from the case, as it is apparently secured with two very small steel pins. So far this has not been an issue, the case has been in use for several months and is holding up well.<br /><br />I recommend this case for anyone considering an ipad mini for child. I would definitely buy it again.\n",

It fit my head very well.  I love the mesh because your head can actually breathe.  You get sweaty enough as it is when running or jogging or playing outside.

      "Nice little lock, with a Four-digit combination that's easy to set. Feels sturdy in the hand, and should fit on any luggage. Ultimately, it's only as secure as the agent who might check your baggage, but the pop up indicator gives an extra layer of security there. It would have been nice to have this when bottles of wine mysteriously disappeared from our luggage, and we'll be using it to hopefully avoid that situation in the future.\n",
      "Puerto Rico is the best all around board game i have ever played. The balance i would say is near perfection and of all the games I've played the score was always very close.<br /><br />While this game out of the box takes a little while to understand the nuances of the rules and how to take advantage of the different roles, it's very worthwhile and rewarding. After two plays, my friends were all very into it and anxious to play again.<br /><br />The fifty foot view of the game looks something like this. Everyone has a board that has an area for placing plantations and city area for buildings. Plantations grow crops, you need certain buildings to produce/store the crops which go in the city area and you eventually want to ship those crops(back to the mainland...whateva) and that's how you ultimately score points. There are variety of different crops you can grow and different types of buildings which give different type of advantages(and are worth a certain # of victory points). Each person takes a turn and on their turn chooses a certain role which is how the game functions. Each role offers different functions/phases of the game, ie building where everyone gets to build a building, or captain where you get to ship your goods....the player choosing the phase typically gets and additional bonus which is where a lot of the strategy revolves around.<br /><br />Some of the things i like about Puerto Rico, are that you really don't know who's going to win until the game ends and the points are counted up. This keeps everyone interested and playing intently throughout. You also have to be alert on each turn and take advantage of other players moves in order be successful. Also, as the other reviewers have stated, luck simply is just not a factor so it's hard for people to be sore losers or point to game flaws that caused them to lose(or someone else to win), instead it's typically a friendly chat about how picking x and y strategy seemed to make the most sense.<br /><br/>The only real downside to this game, is that there really isn't the need for much interaction with other players, or any direct conflict. Those coming from a Settlers of Catan background, the robber phase and the trading are really what makes that...these features are lacking in Puerto Rico. Some say the captain phase can be like the 'conflict', but i disagree. This is a small quibble, and allows you to play with friends and non-friends with no-one getting upset.<br /><br />Many say that this game is too deep for non-gamers and that you may want to start off with simpler games to get up to speed. I would actually disagree with that. I've bought a lot of games in the past few months, and i think we could have played Puerto Rico right off the bat. If you are in the market for new board game, go with this game! Take a quick read through the rules, set it up and take a few rounds to get the questions out of the way...than start over and you'll be all set to enjoy a great game.\n",

      "I love to use bike every day and I have purchased many bike lights in my life. Almost all were somehow difficult to use. The quality, too dim or the battery died quickly, something.<br /><br />I was in a need to purchase a new light and not long ago I came across this one. When I receive the light, I found it to be surprisingly bright, brighter than any flash light or bike light I brought in the past. I am really delighted about the high quality machining as well. The head and the tail turns very smoothly just like my Nikon camera lens.<br /><br />I sometimes feel that the High mode is too bright and when I want to save battery life I just its medium mode that is bright enough.  I found even the low mode is as bright as the other bike lights I had. I like the \"half press” feature of the tail button that changes the mode much easier than other bike lights.<br /><br /> I sometimes commute to and from work in the dark and this light has kept me safe. Great value for the cost.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, this waterproof, astonishing bright LED light is not difficult to use. It is recommended by me to all bike lovers!\n",

      "I was hoping to eliminate bacteria growing in the grooves as in the boards I currently have. I have used these for a few days now and love it for a variety of reasons.<br />1. No deep cuts yet- these are made of a soft material but so far my sharp knives haven't made any marks. That means no bacteria in deep grooves, and no plastic finding its way into my food.<br />2. Dishwasher safe! Easy to throw in for a good cleaning, and they are flexible so they can squeeze in where a firm cutting board would not fit.<br />3. Sterilize in the microwave if you are worried about bacteria. 60 seconds will kill over 99% of bacteria, or so it claims. It can fold up with a built in latch to fit right in the microwave. Not hot when you pull it out either.<br />4. These are color coded with a picture to easily avoid cross contamination. Meat, veggies, fish.<br />5. Lightweight- my baby was once hit in the head when a cutting board fell out of my cupboard right above her. If this cutting board hit her in the head, she'd probably laugh. Very lightweight.<br />6. Love the flexibility! Because these are so flexible, you can cut up your veggies or chicken or whatever, and then fold and dump over your pot. Huge timesaver to avoid many trips with full hands, and then spills of whatever missed your pot.<br />7. Takes up less room in my cupboard! Super thin!\n",

      "probably one of the best things i have ever seen until now, the appgun is more like an extension to a game that the iPhone already has, it doesn't change the game and nothing like that, it just makes it easier for you to play it and the way of playing it.<br /><br />mostly a lot of the accessories about an iPhone might be really expensive and well this is not the problem with this one, a really good advantage about it is that you find an a lot better way of finding the game fun. the gun is not even heavy for no one, is like a little toy a little kid would have,both of your hands can perfectly fit on the trigger and is perfect toy for any kid.<br /><br />i highly recommend it !\n",

When my wife took the test in June, she was well-prepared and said she felt really relaxed because she basically knew what the exam was going to consist of. For that alone, I recommend the book, but all of the other reasons I mentioned help! Great study tool.\n",

      "Becoming Jinn is a beautifully crafted, carefully written tale of 16-year-old Azra who has what we all think we want -- the power to grant wishes (and I say this as a completely biased husband of the author but I assure you, every word is true). Azra is a smart, funny, caustic, bedeviling, and one-of-a-kind character rarely seen in YA.<br /><br />When the silver bangle is clasped around her wrist that provides this power, it's the final straw in a lifetime fighting the inevitable servitude that this precious gift will truly entail. Azra descends from a long line of Jinn -- what we refer to as genies -- and a strong incident in her past has turned her away from magic, her Jinn heritage, and her Zar sisters. Finally unable to escape, Azra is faced with the dilemma of becoming Jinn in a world of humans who she must hide her powers from and yet live among, including the terrific and self-depreciating Henry across the street and her lifeguard crush Nate. Azra must navigate the increasingly complicated world she now inhabits, learning magic, hiding her true self from her friends, and avoiding the Afrit, who rule over the Jinn and keep the wish-granting Jinn and their mothers separated from the males. As Azra's first-person tale unfurls, the author is able to demonstrate the frustration, fear, and confusion we all faced as teenagers and journeyed toward adulthood, jockeying for position, affections, and our rightful place, all with Azra's wry sense of humor and wit, which punctuates the book throughout. The book builds momentum to an unstoppable pace, beginning with Azra's birthday, through her wish-granting, and ultimately to the incidents that bring her full circle in her journey of accepting being Jinn. Barreling to the end, you will finish demanding that book 2 be released much sooner than April 2016!<br /><br />This is a triumphant debut by an author with a particular talent for creating believable and relatable characters, accurate dialog, and terrific turns of phrase. Even if the author wasn't my wife, I would recommend the book to anyone who loves good characters, humor, and a well-executed tale.\n",

The silicone padded handles make them extremely comfortable to use. Also, the handles are wide and hefty enough to enable the user to get a good grip and keep it.

      "This is not a very attractive looking light, but it is quite bright and the long neck turned out to be super helpful as we mounted this light above the barn door under the eave. The long neck allows the light to be in the full sun just about all day.<br /><br />This light comes without any instructions. The only thing you need to know is that the light should be turned on once by pushing a switch in a small hole on the light side (see video). I used a sewing needle to do it, but a paper clip or any other thin thing will work. The light is quite bright. I am attaching several shots of the light over the door of our barn during the day and during the night, you can see that it lights a fairly large area pretty well.<br /><br />One of the immediately noticeable things about this particular solar light was the fact that it would extend out away from a building rather than stay flush against it. This is perfect if you want to light up a walkway or need to push light slightly away from a building. I have a couple of solar lights that are motion-sensing, but so not emit a bright steady light like this one does.<br /><br />There are twelve LED lights beneath the solar panel that even give off some light during the day in a dimmed room. The pole is a generous 15-1/2&#34; long, 1/4&#34; thick, and quite sturdy. On the side with the LED lights it can be activated by pressing a pen into a small hole marked on/off. It's actually quite easy to overlook this and that I did. I had the panel charging, but because I had it facing up I didn't notice.<br /><br />The lighting is excellent and very bright. I do have another LEAGY solar light and the brilliant LED lights are ultra-bright as stated. All of the hardware is included in the package. I very much like the fact that the lighting has the ability to catch the solar rays more readily than those lights that hug the side of a building, a big plus during the winter months.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />1. Sturdy waterproof all-weather stainless steel construction<br />2. Solar-powered lights automatically turn on at dusk and off at dawn<br />3. Provide safety and security in high-traffic areas on your property<br />4. Built-in 2000mAh Battery, 12 ultra bright LED sets to light up 8 to 10 hours at night. The first 7 hours with high brightness, then change to energy saving mode to gradually reduce the brightness.<br />5. Continuous rain day: 2 - 3 days. The LEDs can last up to 5 hours.<br /><br />SPECS:<br /><br />1. Solar panel: 1.8WA battery, current 360mA<br />2. Lithium battery: 2000mAh<br />3. LED: 12 Super Bright LED<br />4. Size: 180* 120* 16mm<br />5. Control mode: Auto Light Sensor<br />6. Material: ABS + UV\n",

      "This 6 pint compartment condiment holder truly simplifies family get together's and other functions.

      "Great ultraviolet light! I felt like a professional forensic investigator while using the light for the first time.  But Identification is the first important step.  I purchased this Uv flashlight at a reduced rate for my evaluation and it worked as indicated.  I was able to determine where my mother-in-laws dogs had urinated on my carpet, then I could deep clean that area.  Great job Escolite! And thanks for the batteries too!\n",
      "I decided to splurge of a selection of 3D printing books to get me up to speed with this exciting new technology, but I am afraid that this was the weakest. The writing style is OK but at just 40 odd pages, there is no real depth. Instead, I much preferred 'Fabricated' by Hod Lipson, which is nearly 300 pages and much better value.\n",
      "The book is very informative, up-to-date and easy to follow and will certainly aid you in the creation of your trust. The creation of a trust is essential to ensure the costly approach of probate can be avoided. Having a previous experience where my fathers estate was virtually wiped out due to probate, I cannot stress how important a trust is. His estate was valued just over $105k, I received around $17k after probate. Probate costs work off the gross value of the estate not the net. I will ensure this dreadful experience is not passed on to my family.<br /><br />The forms themselves are easy to follow with a good set of instructions. They can be downloaded or are available on the CD-Rom which accompanies the book. Each trust has a binding arbitration clause to ensure where beneficiaries contest your decisions, they effectively agree to receive almost nothing. Having visited an attorney, this was highly recommended so it was a relief to see this contained in the forms\n",

      "We ordered this for our daughter's office/guest room. During the day it is a very comfortable couch and at night it easily turns into a comfortable bed. It is really comfortable - better than any other futons or pull out beds that I have tried.

We are very pleased and I relied heavily on the reviews of other customers when I ordered this product.\n",

      "Brighter than the average lantern I recently got. Why didn't I buy this lantern in the first place. Well, I bought a lantern before, but I'm not that satisfied, it has a poor quality performance. I charged the lantern for 2 hours and it drains really faster, well maybe I got the defective one, but I didn't bother returning back since I only got it in a cheaper price. Now, I bought this a couple of weeks ago and it's really bright as all of the reviews said. I am totally happy and satisfied with this Led lantern.\n",

      "I, as many early adopter, who bought this case for the iPad Mini when it first came out just to kick myself when I found out that the sleep and wake up function did not work. It just defeated the whole purpose of getting the case for iPad Mini. However, I received the replacement today and to my surprise, the sleep and wake up for iPad Mini now is working perfectly. They also remove the hideous extra hole in the back. I was going to leave a worst review possible but since they fixed it, I now see no reason to.\n",
      "My Doberman Pinscher Hurley is a great guard dog, but ever since he was a puppy he would bark at anything that moved! I was a little nervous to put a shock collar on him, but the Petiner Advanced No Bark Dog Training Electric Shock Control Collar is nothing like that. After researching the product, I learned that the electric shock is more like a slight tickle which must feel like the light static-like surprise of touching a metal doorknob. After receiving the control collar and putting it on Hurley, I couldn't believe how well he responded to it! He enjoys wearing it more than his usual collar! And it worked like a charm, he stopped barking and it seemed like the impulse to bark just subsided.<br /><br />There's many products that market themselves in the training of stopping barking, but none have worked as well or have been as highly recommended as this one. It's a best buy for all pet owners!\n",

It is especially handy when I am using a recipe off my iPad (I don't have to worry about damaging the screen).<br /><br />Shipping was quick! I was surprised how fast it arrived! Very well packaged- the product was in perfect condition! So happy with this good looking cookbook holder!! I highly recommend it.\n",

      "I have been using these with my iMac instead of Wifi for the last couple months and I have to say I am extremely impressed. I stream Netflix to my computer without the problems I used to have with my Wifi connection and I was using an Apple Airport Extreme. If you want to speed up your internet and don't want to run new wires and if you have cable connections in your house, then this is the way to go.\n",

She loves acting like me in the morning when I am getting ready for work and she is doing her hair as I am and it is absolutely the cutest thing ever. Also in the evening when we get home she always wants me to sit in front of the set and work on my hair and she can do that all day if I allowed her too. This has been one really stable product and I have no issues, it was easy putting it together and she has put it to the test and trust me it is very well made.\n",
      "Works very well making holes for leather belts. If unsure of hole size, I would start with one that fits in the current hole. If still too small, then go to the next larger one and so on until you get the same hole size. You wouldn't want to start too large or the new hole will not look the same as the others. :) Cuts right through the leather with a quick snap, but does indent on the other side. Simply flip the belt over align a very visible indent and finish the cut. VERY clean hole.\n",

      "Of Martyrs and Marigolds lays out the history of the Bengali nation rising out of the ashes of East Pakistan. The story sent chills down my spine. The Pakistan army's horrific massacre of the Bengalis  and the killing of Urdu-speaking people by the Bengalis need to be looked at together. While the atrocities by the Pakistan army has been told and re-told this is the first well written account of both sides of the story. No one wins when innocent blood is shed. The novel is one that should be read by all those who abhor war and violent political conflict.\n",
      "Very nice quality cable for HDMI! I love that it's 6 feet so it can reach my TV to my xbox one which is far way. The cord is very sturdy and it won't come out of the socket too easily once it's plugged in! It's great!\n",

      "Before stumbling upon the Bad Ash 2 (love the name btw) I actually ruined my expensive home vacuum. Even though the debris I was picking up was cold, the vacuum repair guy mentioned that the fine particles just weren't designed to be picked up by a household item and generally clogged up the motor. That's when he suggested I try I vacuum specifically designed for ash and debris pickup. After some research I came across the Bad Ash 2. I tried it and it did an excellent job. If you have a fireplace or are looking for a faster alternative to scooping up your ash with a broom and dust pan, I would highly recommend the Bad Ash 2.\n",
      "My child is almost 2 1/2 years old and loves to cut his play food. It makes him feel like he is preparing his own food and then he pretends to eat it. The food and play knife take a beating, but I've been pleasantly surprised that an excess of paint has not chipped off the various foods.<br /><br />The toy requires concentration, just the right amount of kid muscle to cut through, and eye hand coordination. We've had play dates with younger kids and I feel that 20 months and up is a good age for this toy.\n",
      "Great quality for the price .great at keeping my milk from falling out of the back of my car when I open the hatch .used to keep the essentials for a car. Recommend getting another one for even groceries. Love this product\n",
      "This is exactly what I was looking for. Big enough to take a bunch of keys of various sizes, and I have also bought one for locking to the car when I need to (have become used to leaving the keys on top of the wheels, which is bad bad bad). Very easy to mount and set code. Perfect (and a wee bit better than the others I think).\n",

      "As a diabetes educator, you will hold the tools to aide your clients/patients with managing their diabetes condition. Should not you as the educator educate yourself? Of course, you should. Just look to this guide as your test advisor. It will take you through the testing objectives. It will give you many tips on testing, including a video. It affords the opportunity to take a practice test so that you can show your newly polished study skills.\n",
      "My kids love this! I have twins, both 18 months now and when they decide to have a paddy they usually throw things across the room! Well, with this toy they usually forget why they were having a paddy in the first place because the toy is bendy and changes shape with a squeeze. The kids love to play with it between them.  This toy is soft, flexible and study which keeps it on the top 5 list of favourite toys for my children and the fact that it can survive their wild treatment of it is a testament to its construction.\n",
      "I bought this the other day and it just came in the mail. Works wonderfully. No unpleasant surprises. Powerful and rich sounds. Very good product and I am very happy with it.\n",

      "I ordered the bikini in White 1 size Medium. The bra fit perfectly I’m about average C cup padding was needed for a white and wet material bikini . I was concerned about the bottoms I needed the support more in this area. The bottom fit but gave the swimsuit a whole of appeal. If you need more support just order one size up and you should be fine. The quality of the bikini was great and it looks amazing I would recommend for the price and look of the biking alone\n",

      "My review for this ceramic blade is that ; this ceramic blade cuts fruits and vegetables into beautiful thin slices and I do like that it is light and easy to wash. I have prepared apple cinnamon chips the moment I got mandoline slicer. The only thing I can suggest is \"just be careful\" fortunately I already had metal gloves in my kitchen so, metal gloves and this tool Is just a great match, and slicing fruits and vegetables with this mandoline slicer is just like a walk in the park.\n",
      "I have to admit, I am a huge skeptic of things like this but figured I'd give it a try considering orajel and frozen teething rings were just not helping with my son's discomfort. After about a week, I am a believer. My son isn't nearly as cranky and the redness in his cheeks has subsided. He seems calmer and more happy with the necklace on.\n",
      "Helpful product. Our family bought a new dog and he is not very friendly with stranger people once he start barking at them, then it's like impossible to stop him I tried many products to train him and handle him better, but they don't work as I expected, but this eternal electronic really helped me a lot whenever my dog start barking its just completely stopped him and it's also don't cause any harmful effect\n",
      "On a recent trip to various Caribbean islands, I used a Buddy Book Bag travel money belt.  I have used other money belts, but this one was by far the most comfortable.  The clip stayed fastened so I did not have to worry about it being secure.  The belt's 2 different zippered pockets, allowed me to keep my cash separate from my passport and credit cards.  One of the pockets even had additional dividers that helped me stay organized.  The zippers are strong and the belt is very durable.  This is the best money belt I have ever used.  High quality, comfortable and a great value.  Strongly recommend.\n",

      "Protects my tablet which was my main concern. The magnets that keep it closed are powerful enough to do so. All the holes line up perfectly so you can still take a picture, hear from it, go back etc. Stands up great too. I'm quite pleased and would recommend this product and company.\n",

      "I needed to drill several holes in granite for the bathroom project. It took me a little while to figure things out, especially how to keep the drill bit in position. I must say, I never made holes in granite so quickly! After 5 holes, the bit still looks ok. Could do a few more but I am done anyways. It goes without saying, I used a water bath around the hole to keep the drill bit wet and cool. A ring of plumber's putty does the trick.\n",
      "I love this product! It is VERY sturdy, easy to assemble and great works.  I am really happy with this product, and I will definitely buy it again as a Christmas gift. And this definitely deserves a 5-star!\n",

Plus I can design the bag using Sharpies if I have spare time. LOL\n",
      "Overall Great Grill! the hood seems a bit light, others seem very sturdy. Great Customer Service!

Plenty big enough grill surface for large gatherings.\n",

      "I was pressed to read this book. Ha! I wasn't expecting to like it but I ended up loving it. It's very clever. I like that children's/readers' actions “write the book\" and that it's an enjoyable activity, and that it helps young kids with fine motor skills, and counting skills and with learning colors, and directions (left, right, up, down). As readers follow the directions, it will seem to them that they are creating what's on the next page. What a great idea!<br />This is a very entertaining, interactive book, and at the end kids are invited to read again, and will likely want to read (play) again.\n",
      "Great book. Came in great condition. My daughter loves these books and It made for a great gift! Love this collection!\n",

      "I had been shopping for a vacuum for quite some time when I finally found this one. I had even purchased one and took it back b/c it said it got corners really well and it didn't. The Shark is very light-weight and easy for me to maneuver. It has very strong suction. My allergies have gotten better since I started using it. It gets the dust bunnies under the couch really well with its microfiber pads. I'm really impressed and this is the best upright vacuum cleaner I have had in a long, long time.\n",

      "I travel for work and have small children at home - both are good reasons to have a rugged case for my new Surface Pro 3. The Urban Armor Gear case does not disappoint. Not too bulky, well-built, and light. The kickstand could be a little easier to pull out, but that's a minor criticism. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.\n",

      "I bought this to prevent leg aches that were happening after sitting at my desk for hours at a time (I know, I should get up more, but sometimes you don't).<br /><br />My friend has one of these:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B007LX6MPG<br /><br />This has been perfect. It took a day or two to get used to but now I feel weird sitting in my office chair without it. It's comfortable, holds air great, and you can move around on it without feeling like you are on a seesaw. It's helped my posture as well. I haven't had to reinflate it at all, and I've been using it for a couple of months now. 3 others in my office purchased one and have the same positive feedback. They also don't look as wacky and cumbersome as the exercise ball chairs, and deliver the same results of good posture/abs while sitting at your desk. I also bought one for my mother who had hip replacement surgery and she said it has really relieved pressure when she needs to sit at her computer for awhile. I haven't used it for an exercise tool, but it feels sturdy enough when I stand on it to do a great job for that as well.\n",
      "It is excellent product because all the benefits that they have are indicated, it makes me work for my daily juicing. I highly recommend them.\n",
      "What a relief that there are still some writers willing to push language to its limits.  This book pleases on many levels, from biting satire to goofball antics to startling philosophy. An inspired debut, like Kurt Vonnegut or Tom Robbins but only because there's really no one else doing this kind of thing.\n",
      "This is the perfect to-go mug for me. The insulation is terrific. It keeps my coffee hot for hours, like, really. It's very sealed therefore it doesn't leak at all. The stainless steel design is exemplary. The quality is great too. I've been using it for 2 years now but its performance is still just as superb. It's just great and very affordable. At 20 dollars, you get a mobile thermos and fridge in one  that's gonna last you long.\n",

This product exceeded my expectations on how simple it is to measure. I recommend this product to anyone that requires an accurate measuring tool.<br /><br />Couple things to note:<br />Because this was the first time I used a caliper I made some foolish mistakes (Probably good info to pass on to newbies like myself):<br /><br />I keep poking myself at the depth feature of this tool.<br />I accidentally drain the battery because I did not lock it. Any movement in the caliper will turn on the LCD screen automatically.\n",

After years of searching I finally recognized that my older brother is a narcissistic personality. I read one book after the other. This is one of the very best. It was part of my healing process. The tools offered in this book helped me to value myself as an individual, to identify narcissistic personalities quickly so I have the upper hand over them and to remain calm and confident of myself.\n",
      "What's with people saying the book was bad because the main character was selfish and stupid in her decisions? Do you honestly think this book would be compelling to read if the main character was the perfect character, Mother Teresa, expert backpacker? Name one piece of good literature where the main character is perfect. Would you prefer if Cheryl lied and talked about how perfect she was and how smooth the journey was? Some of the reviews of this book I've read on goodreads are a perfect example of how annoyingly judgmental human beings are.\n",

      "Our home sits on a hill and the driveway is approximately 180 feet long. Sometimes no one in the home can hear if someone is coming up the driveway, especially when it comes to delivery personnel. Even with four dogs that have full access of our property - the dogs just kept on sleeping on our bed. This drives me nuts because delivery people would leave packages any place they wanted to (we have 5 entry doors to our home) and I felt like I was playing a scavenger game hunt...find the package.<br /><br />My husband decided to construct a large wooden package drop off box half way down our driveway. It is very nicely built with the word &#34;packages&#34; in big black bold letters on it. However, there was still no way of knowing when packages were dropped in it. In comes the Sado Tech Wireless PIR  Motion Sensor!<br /><br />Upon receipt I read the instructions and followed how to pair my Transmitter and Remote to the Receiver. It was super easy and I didn't even need to read the instructions that were included, Waved my hand across the Transmitter and it came to life. It has 50 different tones to choose from. Thank you so much Sado Tech now I can feel safe and hear my packages when they come.\n",

It has come into contact with some spilled water and moister but that is all. Easy to connect and simple to charge up. Battery is good and last long and charges fast. The sound it puts out and the bass for only 12 watts is very very good. I get people all the time surprised that the sound is coming from this. I listen to heavy metal and this things holds up.\n",

It allows me to put in on charge and not get the annoying pop up and when you switch to USB mode, you can transfer you pics, music, files, downloads to your laptop or pc.<br /><br />If your USB and charger still works this is a convenient spare. I travel a lot so i just keep this in my travel  bag and im always prepared. We've all had a cable or two missing when you actually need them.  and for $6 dollars you can not worry about that.<br /><br />This cable is compatible with any brand of computer or laptop.

      "White out correction tape is the way to go! Using the old white out, while losing the added benefit or detractor of losing brain cells, also makes it much neater.

      "This isn't a book that you can read and just expect results to show up. It took some work to implement the resume ideas, and some practice to get comfortable with the interview tactics. That said, I felt like the whole book was useful, from the beginning part about setting goals and creating a vision all the way through the end with the information on getting off to a fast start on a new job. After years in a mind numbing, dead-end job, I finally have some hope that better things are ahead. Definitely worth the effort and highly recommended.\n",

      "It's really light, and weighs less than a pound which I like. My DSLR is already heavy enough and I don't need another heavy monitor in my backpack. It plays in full 1080p, and the aluminum cover design protects the screen while I transport it from location to location.<br /><br />As you could probably tell, I use this monitor as a second screen for my DSLR. I have the Canon 5D2, and I've always wanted to buy one of those DSLR monitors to look at a bigger screen when filming. But of course, DSLR monitors are pretty expensive- and this is where I found GeChic 1303H. So far I'm loving it- there aren't any other portable monitors out there that have HDMI and VGA. This is probably the only brand out there. It's reasonably priced- other DSLR monitors are more than 500+.<br /><br />I took it out for filming yesterday and everything was great- I had to use a battery pack to power the monitor. The USB power cable is dual USB- so I had to use two battery packs to power the monitor. Actually one is enough, but sometimes the power supply isn't enough so it is better to use two.<br /><br />Note to other DSLR users out there: I had to use an additional adapter to connect the monitor to my camera. Mini HDMI to HDMI adapter. But I had one already so that wasn't a problem. Just a heads up for the others out there!\n",
      "I bought one of these to use with my desktop computer which is running Windows 7. Plugged it in and we got a message saying the device was installed and ready to use, then it was just a case of opening the software (in this case Skype but we also use the webcam on websites that use a flash plugin for webcams and it works well, too).\n",

      "This collar saved my dog. After tons of research, watching videos, reading reviews, and checking consumer sites I decided to buy Oternal electric no bark collar.This collar is such a miracle worker. Pnut doesn't even bark anymore unless she wants to communicate with other dogs when we go on our walks and hikes. I still put the collar on her when I leave the dorm apartment just in case but it really is just a training tool.this collar is just amazing. It's worth the money investment. I barely use it and the battery is still full after 3 weeks. I would recommend this collar for anyone who wants to keep their dog. This is the miracle collar and works great even on small dogs like my pnut she is a pomchi  weighs about 8 lbs. The collar isn't too heavy for her. She is able to eat, drink, jump on her bed, and function with it on when I'm not home. I do know that my neighbors haven't complained since I have gotten this and they actually like her now and say Hi to me in the hallways instead of giving me dirty looks before I got this collar.\n",
      "This is the solution to my everyday problems. I had purchase one of this recently from a local store the area I live in I would make sure that every single day that when I got on the train I have my earbuds on me to put in my hears just to block out everyone and all the noise that surrounds me. Even when I'm on the bus I would makes sure I put them in my ears.<br /><br />When I'm at the gym working out which ever 3 days in the week I just have to make sure I have them on me to motivate me more to give me the energy in order to work out. I would get another pair of these when they go out.\n",
      "Shipping was good. The Iron gym came as advertised complete with the Ab straps. This provides a very good workout. Narrow grip and hammer grip pull-ups are easy to do with this, but if you try to do a wider grip you'll hit your elbows on the door frame. The abdomen workout that you can do with the ab straps seems to be very effective. I would definitely buy again.\n",

      "Great book, I have the hard copy and kindle version. It was an absolutely informative read as I have been interested in immersing myself into more EB-5 information. It honestly has given me a more high-level, high-ground perspective on the entire industry (especially the investors and developers). I love the step-by-step guide in both the distinctly separated investors and developers section. I thought that was very helpful in separating the roles of the two bigger players in the industry.<br /><br />There is just too much information about EB-5 floating around, specifically biased articles from the media. This book was able to give me a clear-headed idea of exactly how I should approach the people within the industry and how to explain it to those who are interested in entering the industry. EB-5 is definitely a complex industry and it's not something that is easy to just dive into. I believe the book was a great starting point for myself.\n",

      "I feel like Rachel Ray!  I love my pour spout, it is a great way to control the amount of olive oil I use.  I can put a little in a pan, or even use the spout to pour onto my salads and other dishes!  The pour spout pours the oil evenly, and no worries about too much coming out at one time.  Plus there is no dripping of the oil once the bottle is placed upright.  No more drops on stove or counters.  I am actually very pleased with this stainless pour spout!  Cook on!\n",

      "I saw the mandoline slicer for the first time when I watched my friend prepare a gourmet, vegan meal for her guests. She used to be a chef and mentioned this was one of the tools she used to do a more efficient and quicker prepping routine. It's something a lot of professionals use and there's some versions that have up to 5 features depending on what you're cutting, which makes the mandoline slicer pretty versatile. It leaves everything with a cleaner cut, and you can cut more at a faster rate. The hand guard was designed way for safer use (especially when you're going at your prepping routine really quickly) and for easier cleaning. Pretty good idea I think! I got this one plus the professional version.\n",

It's stunning on or off. This light also has 3 lighting options. You can have all the lights on when needed, or just three, or just two.

In a nutshell, its a book designed to teach the reader to hit better by showing them a comprehensive look at the science behind hitting.

      "You have a nose for dirt and catching the bad guy or confirming the good guy. However, you still need some study material to set the record straight. You will get that through the pages of this study. It allows you to find the underlying cause of things when it comes to studying. For example, you will definitely reveal secrets, you will learn how to apply concepts strategically in a general sense, and you will round that all out in some reports. So get to snooping or rather studying.\n",

      "Indeed we can live to our highest potentials and make our short lives here on Earth as meaningful as possible. Thank you so much for writing eye-opening book. It's great to be given a pep talk on life and be reminded how much potential every person possesses. The fact that you are alive today makes you special having fought your way into human existence before conception. Even when we seem weaker than the rest, we can still rise up above the challenge and live our lives to the fullest by taking advantage of our situation in life. It doesn't matter whether we seem successful or not. Real success come from knowing our real value as a human being, that infinity we contain within our souls. I highly recommend this everybody right now. Our generation needs more writers like Olaoluwa to remind us that we are not our stuff. We are not our looks. We are who we are because of our souls and all the wonders we possess inside.\n",
      "Disclaimer: this review is based on an advanced preview of the book<br /><br />I have worked in a limited capacity with Javascript and jQuery in the past - and found this book useful for filling in the holes in my understanding of how Javascript in particular actually worked. There were lots of points through the book where I found things out that I probably should have known but had never quite understood.<br />I also liked the way the software engineering focus to writing code in a style suitable for large applications.<br />The overview of the client side data storage APIs is the area I probably learned the most (I had really only heard of these before - never used them) and will definitely use these in the future.<br />I also learned a lot I didn't know about the new Javascript APIs around files and web workers.<br />The web application developed through the book is relatively simplistic - it would have been nicer if it was slightly more complex - but probably it was sufficient for demonstrating the subjects of the book.<br />Overall I would recommend for intermediate and senior programmers - but anyone new to Javascript may want to buy a beginners book first.\n",

I like to let my eyes adjust and use as little light in addition to the available ambient light and I particularly like the dimmer feature. My wife appreciates the fact that the lowest lumens setting provides plenty of light for my night-time reading, thereby minimizing the disruption to her sleep. The strap is comfortable and of good quality, easy to adjust. I like the way it switches between white and red light.\n",
      "Great sound. This is comparable to my Big Blue Live from Brookstone. What I like better about this product is that the speaker itself has controls to change songs, pause, and control volume. This way, you can keep the speaker near the pool/lake/etc and keep your iPod or phone away from water and control music on the speaker\n",

      "For those of you who know, the Peak by devicewear is a \"Wedge\" style case. It is name this way because you can use the wedge shape that it makes to put it in either a horizontal, landscape or any other way you want it. I like this style of case because you get the most sturdy stand and don't have to worry about the case. I also like this style because I like to type small notes and the typing mode makes that really easy. I also like the way the ipad looks like it's framed in by the case. The stitching really is done well and makes the case stand out. I recommend this case highly to everyone I talk to and think it is a really great case.\n",

      "A book spawned with deep intellect and even deeper philosophical meaning comes Yuehai Xiao's Crossing the Seas: A Diary of My Thoughts is a book of sheer empowerment to humankind. This book is written in diary format, which for one I love. It made it so easy to read and to absorb. I feel absorbance is the purpose. When we absorb things we become forced to think about them. Thought is a power motivator in life. People in this world are no longer free thinkers. We watch exactly what is put in front of us, and we accept it as gospel.<br /><br />When you read this book you know acceptance is not option. Xiao's has obviously taken much time and put much thought into this book. We as people have to learn to upgrade our thought process. I for one am an academic. I can test with the best and score high. I have excellent memorization skills. But it goes no further than that. Yes I am memorizing but I have never learned to absorb it. I am 37 years old. And it's truly sad. When it comes to my life I am testing at a D level at best.<br /><br />If we continue on this path of learning and not absorbing we are a doomed species. I think this book it gets to the heart of it all. So our youth can grow, learn and absorb. It has always been about how much you can learn and how fast. It needs to be about what you learn and what you can absorb, and use to help humanity. I believe that this book is trying to help us a people open our minds wider so we can absorb more. It's definitely a book that will leave you with a lot to think about in the end.\n",

      "This is some of the best &#34;magic&#34; transparent tape, which you can write on and has a &#34;gloss-like&#34; finish. There are many pretenders out there and copies of this original, and we have tried some of them from time to time. But, we always return to this &#34;the standard of magic transparent tape&#34; because it is thick enough, strong enough, but tears fairly easily and can be written on. We found by purchasing this in bulk, we can purchase it for a price comparable to the cheaper knock-offs and get the real thing, and good quality\n",

By implementing what we've learned in this book, we are back on the road to redemption.<br /><br />The screenshots and explanations in the book are clear and really help you understand the concepts. Our company's supply chain is complicated and uses nonstandard workflow. Even so, this book nailed the points we needed to cover.<br /><br />Definitely read this book if you need help planning your supply chain using SAP APO.\n",

      "At first I was a bit skeptical about buying a book from a new author but I<br /> must say this was well worth it. To be honest I think the price should be<br /> more for this book. It embodies so many levels of real life. We all have<br /> felt unaccepted and unloved at some point in our lives and Reason Why I<br /> Sing shows what happens to people just like us. We sell our souls for a<br /> chance to be loved and accepted. The most intriguing part to me is how we<br /> sell our souls and don't actually realize that that's what we've done. I'm<br /> going to recommend this book to my book club friends because I think<br /> they'll have a blast discussing it.A\n",

      "I'm happy i got this. $50$ wasn't much for all the clock has. The clock is tiny but gives off great loud music and the whole thing works off the remote, i would buy it again, it's exactly what i wanted.\n",
      "I love this pizza cutter!! I have an old one that you have to cut the pizza over and over again but with this one it goes right through the crust with ease. It has a nice large wheel, unlike my old one, which makes cutting the pizza a breeze. This is a fantastic high quality pizza cutter that I would highly recommend. We have used it several times now and love it!\n",
      "This book is truly amazing because of the information in it.  The author was insightful enough to predict the demise of the honey bee that we are faced with today.  It was great background information for my own book, [[ASIN:B00EYOG02A Bless the Bees: The Pending Extinction of our Pollinators and What We Can Do to Stop It]].  I recommend it to anyone desiring to know more about the causes and solutions.\n",
      "We gave to Great-granddaughter for Christmas to complete her LittleTykes kitchen. She loves playing/making and serving the food. A few items were small or narrow and since she is under 3 yo, we did remove those items before play. Overall, the set is cute, realistic, and contains &#34;just about everything&#34; a child could identify with!\n",
      "One wonderful aspect of this tummy tucking belt is that it can be used by both men and women and comes in a free size..thus my whole family can use it now.\n",
      "Nice ergonomic hand strengthener. Easy to simply have around in the office or home to grab and use whenever. Very good!\n",
      "Really impressed with this product. Super easy to use and is very accurate. I am a home health nurse and I'm super impressed and use it all the time\n",
      "I usually try to avoid powdered cheese since they either make me cough or sneeze, and that can get really annoying. Surprisingly, this doesn't do that so I can fully appreciate the taste without worrying about choking on what I'm eating.\n",
      "Exactly as pictured. Large enough to fit books, binders and lunch bag, and I love the fact that there are lots of pocket in the bag, so I can finally find the place for my small things.\n",
      "I've owned, used and abused, several tripods in my life, but this is clearly one of the best, though not the lightest. Yes, it's a bit heavy, but it won't fall down and with the shoes that come with it you can shoot on a sandy or slicky beach, even put the tripod on rocks, if you have to to get the shot, without worrying too much, though I'd worry anyway, can't help myself.<br /><br />This is also my first Vanguard tripod and after having used it for awhile now, I don't know why I haven't had one before, because it's apparent to me now that Vanguard is a company with photographers on their mind.\n",
      "I have two teenage boys at home who work out at the gym five times a week, hike, rock climb, play soccer, wrestle and run. Lot of shoes and they all smell terrible! It sticks up their rooms and my mini-van! This is a product the guys are willing to use regularly, and it has made a huge difference in the atmosphere of their rooms. Smells great, not like medicine or a nursing home, but fresh, outdoorsy and clean. The big size is a plus for us, needless to say :) Fast delivery. Will be back for more!\n",
      "This is the one thing I won't forget to bring during a long trip  or flight. keeps my neck from aching even if I sleep on it. Really comfortable to use. I've been using this for quite some time now but it is still functional.\n",
      "The price was quite fair, but no complaints about the product, perfect for smash bros lovers, works fine with Wii u and dolphin, perfect for friends group.\n",
      "Great, works as advertised,<br />I have them mounted on my steps to the 2nd floor<br />now there is no need for any lights burning over night.Also for this price,and quality,I cant love them more.Best light I EVER bought.I plan to order more in the near future\n",
      "I bought these for the sole purpose of pulling smoked pork butts for pulled pork sandwiches. These make the task so much easier than using large forks. I pulled two six-pound pork butts in under five minutes. These things are great!\n",
      "After hearing all the bad reviews about getting a Caniam brand and such I decided to really research into this.<br /><br />So I emailed many sellers of what their logos were on it. There was only two sellers who told me that they had the Canon logo (W&H Store) and (Pocket Store).<br /><br />I decided to go with W&H Store cause they were cheaper and boy did I make the right choice. Lens came extremely earlier than expected and it did indeed have the Canon logo and Made In Japan text. As a person who loves photography and almost anything to do with it, this mug was a great buy.<br /><br />First thing I tried when I got it was testing if it really kept water in, as told by other reviewers. It leaks water from the drinking spout when you hold it upside down, but of course, the spout is just a hole with a cover, and why would I be drinking coffee upside down? So that didn't really matter.<br /><br />So other than that, this mug was a great buy, looks realistic, holds a nice capacity of coffee, and looks really realistic. I trick a lot of people into thinking It's a real lens when they first see it, so I wouldn't be surprised if I accidentally tried to stick this on my camera from time to time.\n",
      "I have used this carrier for more than 4 months. I just want to say it's awesome.It's easy to put on. This carrier is very soft.Beats having to walk around with a huge stroller when you just need to run a quick errand<br />Love the pockets in the front<br />At first i was try to used it with both in front but as they got heavier it was easier with one in the front and one in the back. I am happy about my purchases .\n",
      "This product worked perfectly on my T Post in my back yard.. Keep them kids and my dog safe.<br />Thanks\n",
      "Use this product for your foods and enjoy the benefit of a good healthy life. I know hemp oil for years ever since I have been using [[ASIN:B00DBB4A60 Dew Drops Hemp Oil Supplement 2oz Extra Support Formula (Cinnamon)]]. Actually it was the only hope I had for my poor anxiety mother. Her cold have been miserable life was totally prevented by that excellent hemp oil product. So when I heard about this product, I did not hesitate but bought it. Now we use it for many kinds of foods we make. It actually worked pretty well. The diseases rate of my family greatly came down.\n",
      "These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00E9262IE  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UN5Z1BK  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode andnot stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UN5Z1BK\n",
      "I only use it to watch movies in my backyard and take it with when I travel so I haven't used it a lot yet, but I think it is a good product.\n",
      "I'm really supprised at how great this is for the price - it came amazingly well packaged in it's box, installed as though an OEM part and has printed a couple hundred pages so far without a hitch.\n",
      "Vinyl Decal Sticker is perfect for keyboard. Quality is very high quality. It has given my keyboard a new look. I like it very much..\n",
      "Nice tablet, bought it about a week ago and I've been using it for a few days now. The design looks cool and I haven't gotten any issues with it yet. The tablet is working smooth and is easy to hold in your hands. Me, my kids and my wife love this tablet!\n",
      "I love the tights. they are very well made. I am a fishnet fanatic and these are awesome. Very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Fun speaker!! has some great sound does not distort and love that fact it has a mic so I can use it in the car or where ever I am! People can hear me pretty well so I am very happy with the purchase. Would deff recommend it\n",
      "I do daycare, and this has been a favorite since we received it. I'm usually very pleased with Vtech toys in general, but this one hits it out of the park. I have one child who sits independently, and is just learning hand eye coordination. All he has to do is graze it with a touch, and it lights up, and plays music. He loves it. Then I have a 21 mo. old and we are starting to work on colors and such. The toy has a switch, and it changes it to a learning toy, so when things are touched it says colors and what not. Plus the fact that it's a walker, which is perfect for the almost 12 mo. old. Don't even get me started on the &#34;peek a boo game&#34; they can play, that gets an eruption of giggles!\n",
      "I am very pleased with this swim cap. Usually I have to struggle to get my hair up in the cap and then before my swim is completed, my hair has begun to come out in the back. This one works great.\n",
      "This is a very nice little tablet for the price. The tablet arrived nicely packaged with a charger, USB cable and USB keyboard adapter cable. Also included was a nice instruction booklet. Awesome video streaming with an excellent screen resolution. It's perfect for me. I love it\n",
      "Works great with my LaserJet 1300 printer and lasts a long time. I would definitely recommend it and will purchase the product in the futures. Thanks.\n",
      "Really nice chalk for indoor or outdoors. I used it indoors first to make sure the chalk was actually good and I'm very happy with it's performance. I've used other chalks before that have been pretty crappy and barely kept my hands dry for one attempt but this really does stay on your hands. The cool thing is, is that it is rock colored so it blends into the rocks you climb on. Works well and is eco-friendly.\n",
      "Pros： I removed a car battery on an Accord and just clamped the connectors twice firing interval two minutes. The car started right up with no hesitation.Cons:There is power display only when the power switch turn on charging.\n",
      "It is awesome once it is on the tab but getting it on without air bubbles was a bit challenging. Was glad the pack came with three of them because the first one had way too many air bubbles and I had to use the second one. Had my husband do the second one and he did a much better job than I did. Still had a few tiny air bubbles but they are only visible when the screen is black.\n",
      "This tablet stand is really innovative product, which allows us to use tablet in bed very comfortably without holding it. it also relieves of the neck and back pain, which without this stand, people usually get due to their posture while using tablet. It is compatible with most of the famous tablets and is very useful. I am glad I got to try this product, and I really liked it.\n",
      "I bought this yogurt maker from an appliance store on a whim! I just suddenly loved the idea of making my own yogurt since I'm on a diet. I thought I could create my own flavors and I'm very happy with this machine. I felt like a child again playing with my play-doh set that makes clay French fries. It makes yogurt wonderfully just like store-bought yogurt!!! Love it! Very easy to operate, very easy to clean!\n",
      "My friend introduce this keyboard to me. It is very nice and has a strong quality. Nice and lasting product.\n",
      "The product quility seemed good, but the advertisement said it was two sets of filters. My unit takes two filters each so I assumed I would get 4 filter units. I only recieved 2. They are calling a set, 1 filter. I didn't look to see if the quanities were correct on the advertisement.\n",
      "I had an old reverse osmosis water filter system for a few years until it started to leak and smell bad. The ispring system is at a third of the price<br />but does the same thing. Installation is quite easy than the older one. I do not reuse the old tubing because they are not in good shape but I learned the procedure from the plumber for the older one. The user manual is quite clear. I encourage people to install it yourself.\n",
      "This was very helpful during my last trip to India.  I'm sorry but the water that came out the sink was yellow. I couldn't possibly drink that and buying bottled water was expensive and utterly useless.  I decided to just use my filter straw.  I felt more at peace drinking from the filter straw than water from the apartel.  I just saved a lot from by using the straw and works great.\n",
      "Any of the colorforms line is sooooo good for kids. My kids go crazy and it occupies their attention so well. The stickers are restickable anywhere. If u have a car, they're perfect for car windows!\n",
      "This is by far the most durable coffee cup set that is available. The cups are of a really good quality and are in a very close to real shade of a green small sized cactus, which is not growing in the Sahara desert but is placed eloquently in the kitchen. However, you will have to keep an eye on the little ones, who may mistake it for a real cactus and get all excited.\n",
      "Got mine recently, and I am very happy with it. The 2 in 1 peeler/julienne is great! I just got done peeling carrots for a salad later, and I used the Julienne side to create some pretty neat zoodles and other strips - worked like a charm. The eBook is nicely done, and really useful - it provides some nice recipes which I look forward to trying out. I really like the tong too. Just peel and strip, and use the tong to place, which makes it so much easier and much less time consuming! I wanted to make sure I threw my 2 cents in, because this is a great tool at a great price with awesome value! I'll most definitely buy from this seller again. Thanks Iann.\n",
      "One of the BEST personal development books I've ever read!!! I was going through a very tough phase in my life and this book helped me get back on track. Thank you Anthony for this life changing treasure!!!!!!\n",
      "It does what it's supposed to. The units of measure are accurate and line up with a tape measure made locally.\n",
      "I can't believe some people actually complain about this and leave negative reviews. Come on people - this is not caliming to be a 500 dollar comforter set. For the price you pay here, you're getting a damn good comforter for that money. And to me it actually feels way more expensive anyway.\n",
      "6 screws, 4 o-rings, 1 Allen Wrench If you can't put this together in less than 10 minutes you probably can't ride a bike anyway. Only one thing easier: ease of use. I have a small basement apartment with stairs that lead up to the owner's apartment. As these stairs are never used, I placed the base legs of the stand on one of the wider bottom steps and leaned it against the wall. The top bar that leans against the wall has a soft rubber/plastic cushioning pad - so it makes no marks on the wall. Also with stand leaning out away from the wall and hooks straight out - my bike's handlebars never touch the wall. Unless you hang a motorcycle from the hooks - they're not going to slip down. Excellent design! Great value! You will not be disappointed.\n",
      "This product is so cute..I've covered small and medium cups..it suctioned the cup to prevent any spills\n",
      "Does good. I like the 360 degree but I doubt how much I will use vertical now. I used to use it a lot but for now I don't.\n",
      "What I liked most about this candle is that it actually does what it claims to do...as it is made of soy wax the candle has a much longer life.\n",
      "This doomed crystal skill shot glass is bad to the bone. Bad a## addition to my collection. Looks cool with colored beverages.\n",
      "I was looking for sme high quality HDMI cables so  I bought this 2-pack. I am very satisfed! Very resitive, high quality material, length is enough as i need. This nice cables works really great and fast. I really recommend it! I will also buy this cables to my friend!\n",

      "This subwoofer is pretty dang big, bigger than what i was expecting. Very solid build, the wood is real. The grill plate is heavy, solidly made and protect it well. I have to keep this unit turned down pretty low, it rocks the neighborhood.<br /><br />Hands down, if you have $200-500, look at this and no other.\n",
      "amazing instrument.  You can't really tell if it's working until you get some reaction from your dogs.  Mine have responded.  I can call my dogs without waking my baby girl.\n",
      "If you live in an area that has a lot of winter snow, you will love this car cover. I bought one for myself and my friend. I have a small car, and my friend has a SUV. The cover worked fine for both our cars. It even covered the wipers! Part of the cover goes inside the car to add to the cover's security. Magnets are on the edges to keep it in place on the windshield. The cover is lightweight; so, it's easy to use everyday if neccessary. We just had our first snowstorm for the year, and the cover held up just fine in the midst of gusting winds.  I also have the added bonus of not having to scrape off windowshield ice. I would highly recommend this cover to anyone living in a snowy environment.\n",
      "Very helpful-- we now have a much better understanding of what coaches are looking for and how to get on their radar. Lots of great tips, easy to read and covered all of our questions. Great resource for parents!! We've referenced several times after the first read.\n",
      "Really nice sling pack and very stylish. Zippers work very smoothly. Has plenty of pockets. Comfortable to wear. It feels really great on my back and seems to be fairly durable.\n",
      "&#34;This is by far the best wine opener I have found. It is made of quality material, so it should last a long time.<br />Now I no longer have to open the wine for my wife, she can open it for me.<br />I also bought one for a friend and she thinks it is the best also (no it's not my girlfriend, it is a family friend - ha, ha).&#34;\n",
      "Very easy to install. Works great no issues. All programing is done from the phones them self. Very easy to move phones around and ext. Install take around 1 hour from start to finish. you can have up to 6 phones and up to 16 phones. Voice mail you can setup an automated attendant and also a schedule that turns on and off your night mode voice mail. would buy again. Also comes in different colors for the phones which you can mix and match if you want.\n",
      "It was not much but i do like surprising my girlfriend for no reason.  She really does like it! She uses it all the time.\n",
      "This is just perfect! I have been looking for this earring all my life. Finally found it! The style is so simple yet very elegant and attractive. it is beast wear in a party or any event especially when you are wearing a long gown or just your best Sunday dress. My husband just love the way I look every time I have this in my ear. I also love the fact that I got this in a very affordable price. Great purchase!\n",
      "This is a revolutionary product that is ready to go straight out the box.  It is easy to adjust and has hard magnets (instead of the flexible ones) that stay in place when the deflector is on ceiling vents.  It does a great job of directing air or heat into the actual room instead of letting the air blow off to the side.  I really like how this deflector is saving me on energy costs because now the house is able to cool down or heat up at lower temperatures. It's transparent; so it doesn't clash with your wall paint or furniture arrangements. I am going to buy some more as back ups.  It's really a great invention that helps save on energy.\n",
      "Substantial fixture, very heavy and looks great. At first, I was a little skeptical it would be cheaply made or mostly plactic because of the  reasonably cheap price, but I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of craftsmanship! It is made of all chrome and brass, with no plastic on the actual wand. I do not aggree with other reviewers, the hose is very well constructed and does not have any spots or rust, and likes flat against the wall because of the rotating connectors on both ends.<br /><br />This shower completes a modern shower, highly recommend!\n",
      "I just wish we had more &#34;Organic&#34; Libby's veggies. I think<br />I am ordering cases of whatever is being offered at this point<br />and look forward to more coming on the market.\n",

      "These bottles are a nice quality and seal very nicely.These have been good for everything I've put in them so far.I would recommend these bottles if you are looking for something small to separate liquids.\n",
      "if you don't have a forecaster i think this is the perfect one for everyone, very accurate and very precise when is about the temperature outside or inside your home, i think this one is one of the most complete forecasters because it will give you the current weather you are inside of your house and it can also give you the current weather outside of your house.<br /><br />works with AA batteries and it doesn't matter what brand you use because the forecaster doesn't wastes so much battery, the forecaster is like a TV control remote as much as you use it, you will not have to change the battery until like after two months or so.<br /><br />i really like this forecaster because i can every time i use it i immediately get the weather forecast of my location, i love it.\n",
      "WOW! this 3D RC is so easy to use and so cheap. I love to play around with the quadcopter. Its fun and you can use it anywhere you want. I would recommend to buy this for little kids.\n",

      "Me, my husband and my kids are having a blast using this contraption. I made cocoa for myself and my husband and kids make their own cappuccino cups. It is very easy to use and clean. So if you also want to have a delicious coffee at home buy it. I bet it won't be a money waster.b\n",
      "As you can see the design of this case is specially built for small kids you can see the small details in the product that have been thought of to build this.<br />The handle is flexible and can turn into a stand to enjoy games, movies and other apps because at time small kids can't hold the ipad for long.<br />This product has all of my votes and I recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "This is a set of two, which is great for those of you with two gaps to accommodate. My Chevy Impala only has one, so I have a spare on hand in case something happens to the one I'm currently using.\n",
      "Easy care and easy wear. Just slip it on and go. It is already lined and so no slip required. I hope it shrinks a little when I wash it, but will not dry, just fluff and then hang it up.\n",
      "I love this case it is the perfect size for my grandson to bring some cars over to grandmas when he comes.  It hold 9 matchbox cars, has a zipper to open and close and a nice handle to carry. The details are nice and bright and vivid. I love it perfect gift!! It even came with a red car !!!\n",
      "I am impressed with these mugs. They are large, look nice and are sturdy.These are really cute and they look just like they do in the product picture. The colors are bright and cheerful, and they hold a good amount of coffee. They are all in perfect condition, and having the nice assortment of colors allows everyone to keep track of their own cup.\n",
      "Best gift to families with children with garden or to restaurant playgrounds! High quality material, easy to set up or set off. Very resistive to weather and damaging. Safe for children or adults! Cheap, safe. Can recommend to all!  Awesome quality stuff for cheap price, Simply best buy ever.\n",
      "The manual is very good at explaining the various options and how to replace-upgrade the internal SATA HDD but, as expected, there's not much advice on the physical layout. Without actually deploying the system by mounting the cameras, I was able to test its features and these are my findings.<br /><br />Cameras are clear and good quality. The remote app really needs improvement. Some days i can see my cameras, while other days i cannot. After several factory resets, i was able to get it to work but is still not 100% reliable. I will only be using these cameras 1.5 months out of the year for my Christmas light show display. I do not want my expensive light controllers to walk away or neighborhood kids messing with my stuff in the yard. This system works great for this, but a long term NVR, i would recommend.\n",
      "It's been a year since I bought this device and the light is still strong! Now that I know that it last longer, I will buy another one for extra use. The experience of using this Led lantern was amazing! I use it for camping, power outages, fishing and even the rain will not stop this device from lighting my way. This is my number one light buddy.\n",
      "the dress's size and style is very suitable for me, the color is very good, nice clothes, fabric is very comfortable, friends and colleagues are all say very good-looking\n",
      "I am just a little bit overweight and whenever i fly airlines, its hard for me to put the belt on because the belt doesnt extend out enough. This belt does add a lot of extension and I could fly comfortably now.\n",
      "This is truly an awesome product.  It's a good thing the reviews here were accurate.  I deserves a 5 star rating easy.  It's easy to use. Provides safe drinking water.\n",
      "This chair is awesome. It looks like a real Stickley, but for a fraction of the price. I am extremely happy with it. I got it as a gift for my daughter who is expecting a baby. It seems to be made extremely well too.\n",
      "I love just plugging my USB into the front, not on back as most machines.Love that I am able to record.I am so glad a took a chance and bought this machine instead of others.<br />  This is rare and deserves a 5 star. I highly recommend this product!\n",
      "This product really works, I was buying it a few weeks ago, and every member of my family mentioned, that he/she felt a difference about the water quality. They really hold what they promise. You really feel, when you hold it, and use it, that this is a quality product, not such a cheap ****, which you use and after half a year you have to be a new one! Recommendable!\n",

      "This is a great guide for any person who really concerns about their health status. Everything is based on scientifically proven facts. The author uses his collected experiences to give us an excellent guide to show how to control the blood sugar level and keep well away from being a diabetic patient. Some facts are a little difficult to understand for ordinary flacks who are unaware of science. That is actually the major minus point about this book. Other than that, the book is simply awesome. For such people who need something pretty useful and effective and easy to understand, I recommend [[ASIN:B00CWYQA6K Kick the Sugar, Feel the Freedom]]. It is as good as this guide.\n",

      "No kitchen should exist without a reliable cast iron skillet, and no skillet should be less than this one. Reliable, easy to clean and use, you won't have a hard time gauging the heat. I cook a lot of dishes with this one, mine already has good mileage and it's still asking for more.\n",
      "I'm still amazed at the quality of these cables for the price. And they include- for free- a right angle adaptor, good cable ties, a cleaning cloth and a mini flashlight. I tie the flashlights to the backs of TVs so I can find the slots. Go look what this set would cost at the big box, and you will be amazed too.\n",
      "I don't know why home made baked french fries taste so much better when they are quickly and evenly cut (other than the fact that they cook evenly), but they do. This is lightweight but sturdy, easy to use and easy to clean! It will be used in heavy rotation in my kitchen, very pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "Great product! New way to serve veggies.  I especially loved the recipes that came with the product.\n",
      "I simply love how different this french press is from the average. Its so classy. It looks beautiful on the table when making breakfast for guests and you want to have a buffet style breakfast. I also belive that since it has the stainless steel design it keeps the coffee hot alot longer. That is definitely a plus when you are lounging and talking at breakfast. This french press is dishwasher safe so that means cleaning it isnt a hassle. I would definitely recommend this french press to every coffee snob out there.\n",
      "I wind up using this way more than I thought I would.  It glows blue at night which I don't really love but I run it for about 8-10 hours on a bottle-full of water maybe a foot away from my head and I wake up with my nasal passages clear and happy. I often wake up very dry otherwise.  I know - there are big humidifiers that do the same thing, I've had them.  This little guy is a pleaser.  Fires right up shooting mist immediately.\n",

My one complaint is that I would've liked it to be a little longer, the color of the bed skirt is perfect, and it was easy to place on my box spring. The price of this bed skirt was fabulous, and it was delivered really fast. I'm really happy that I found this bed skirt here on Amazon.<br /><br />Is it a thick, hotel-quality, fancy material? Does it get the job done? Yes. It is exactly what it says it is and you get exactly what you pay for. The material is thin, but it is only 200 thread count. I expected that.

      "I LOVE THIS BOOK AS I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED WHAT THE VARIOUS WORLD RELIGIONS THOUGHT OF ANGELS. THIS IS THE ONLY SUCH BOOK ON THE TOPIC THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN AS SUCH AND IT PRESENTS SOME VERY INTERESTING INFORMATION AS HOW IMPORTANT AND CRUCIAL THE ROLE OF ANGELS IS IN THE VARIOUS HOLY BOOKS OF THE MAJOR RELIGIONS. IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING TO KNOW THAT THEY PLAY SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE RELIGIONS AND ARE VERY SIMILAR IN THEIR APPEARANCE AS INVISIBLE SPIRITS AND LIGHT BEINGS AND THAT THEY ARE MENTIONED HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN THE BIBLE FOR INSTANCE AND IN EVERY MAJOR RELIGION THEY ARE VERY PROMINENT IN THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY. VERY INFORMATIVE BOOK AND DESRIBES HOW THEY ARE DESCRIBED IN EACH OF THE MAJOR RELIGIONS.\n",

      "''We moved to a new house with a longer driveway and the view of the street is barely visible through all the trees and shrubs. Not to mention, we live on a dirt road, so every time someone drove by it almost sounded as if they were pulling in the driveway.<br /><br />After reading reviews on multiple products I decided to go with this long range Skylink kit. It was here in a matter of days and I had it setup within minutes. I screwed the sensor to the base of a tree 10' from the street and have the alarm in the kitchen. Probably 200' apart.<br /><br />It works like it should and lets me know when someones here. ''\n",

      "I REALLY like this set, I had NO slipping or breaking issues. My is over 2 years old, I use them almost daily & 1 just broke. I especially like the smallest one. It makes getting to the bottom of jars like mayo, peanut butter, etc really easy. I like the curved one for scoping & scraping cake batter & things like that. It would be best to hand wash these, the handles tend to get fragile over time from the dishwasher. I bought a set may 2012, the small handle just broke but I really feel I got more than my money's worth. I am ordering these again. I've not had a chance to use these yet except to empty a soup can but I am impressed by them and believe they will hold up very well. The handles feel good, solid and easy to grip.\n",

      "Striking a near-perfect balance between grit and sensationalism, it takes viewers through a world marked by violence, double-dealing, and racial division, with an emphasis on the ambiguous morality and personal and familial baggage that come with a life lived between the straight world and the criminal one. The machinations of the characters and the twists of the plot are almost operatic, but the show remains rooted in the harsh realities of gangland.\n",

I like that it's just a one touch control because I don't want to fumble around if I'm on a hike or a run. The construction of this is good and it doesn't slip or slide down. This will be great for camping in the summer, it's pretty handy just to have around the house too.\n",

      "Vesta (my better half) and I are Burners. We go to Burning Man out in the Black Rock desert every year. If you haven't been, it's a week long gathering of about fifty thousand people in what are sometimes very harsh conditions. Google it if you're interested. They have porta potties out there, but in the middle of the night I just don't feel like getting out of my tent, putting on my shoes and hiking to one to take a pee or the other.<br /><br />So we bought one of these and a little red tent and some cat litter and some baking soda and some TP and some small but sturdy trash bags and made our very own loo. We set up the red tent next to our main tent, put the portable loo in the center of it, lined it with a trash bag, dumped some cat litter and baking soda in it and we were good to go. Literally.<br /><br />After peeing or pooing, you take off the seat, removed the trash bag, tie it up, replace with another bag, litter and soda, put the seat back on and you're good to go again.<br /><br />Burners take everything out of the desert with them, included pee and poo, so the cat litter and baking soda are very necessary, cuz the litter hardens the pee and the soda kills the smell.<br /><br />I can't say I'm in love with this portable loo, because who could love a toilet. However, I know this, I'd hate going to the desert without it.\n",

      "I use my LED desk lamp almost every night.  I really love its modern and minimalist look.  It just feels so high tech.  The round base barely takes up any space on the end table at the side of my bed.  I like that it can fold up when not in use.  The three light color options come in handy depending on my mood and the five dimming levels allow for several brightness options throughout the day. The light feels really natural and doesn't flicker at all. The rating on the LED bulb life expectancy means I shouldn't have to replace the bulb for at least a couple decades! One of my best buys on Amazon!\n",

As he touched the topic of self branding and marketing I was totally shocked at the stupid things I thought were great strategies. This is definitely a great piece of work, great read\n",

      "Long before the phrase \"it takes a village\" was coined, our town of Gouyave had all the ingredients it took to raise good young men of high caliber like Collis DeCoteau. He has now returned the favor by encapsulating his experience as a young man growing up in that environment and makes no apologies; not that any is required.<br /><br /> \"A Place Called Gouyave, is a masterfully well written book by Collis DeCoteau. He brought to the forefront, a time capsule that encompasses the liveliness of a people; their effervescent culture; their exuberance and their warmth which is and continues to be the foundation of our Gouyave people.<br /><br />In the only way it could have been written, DeCoteau's short stories reminded us of a culture that is commonly shared all over our Caribbean Islands on a grander scale but presented with that unique Gouyave flavor that he willingly shares.

      "So I've bought 4 ultradiscs at this point, two i bought at REI, the other two off amazon.<br /><br />If you haven't already looked at this you should<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B007CZLABY/<br /><br />-if you're looking for a product made in the US, this is it<br />-if you're looking for a disc with an good balance of control, speed, and distance, this is it<br />-if you're looking for a disc that will last you for a good 5 years or (probably) more, so long as you don't chuck it at cement, trees or rooftops, this is it.<br /><br />the first disc I bought got roofed a few years back, and since then I needed a new disc, I considered whamoo, but found their discs were super flimsy and when I've tossed them they have way too much float for my taste.<br /><br />later I found the nite glow disc, and bought it of amazon, loved it, was just like my regular disc in shape/size/weight, and with age the glow improves. btw, the picture isn't exaggerated, the camera was just set at a very high film speed, I managed to get the same affect on my android phone by adjusting the ISO number to 1250.<br /><br />I recently purchased the ultraviolet disc, and love it as well. again, it's the same shape/size/weight as all the other ultrastar discs. the color changes when exposed to sunlight, the higher the UV level the faster and more dramatic the change in color from white to purple (in low UV conditions, like a cloudy day the disc may only turn a light pink color). when changing it back to white, it changes a lot faster when put in absolute darkness rather than just putting it in the shade.<br /><br />the only color i don't recommend is black, because on a hot summer day, the sunlight will actually cause the plastic of the disc to soften, thus allowing the disc to lose it's shape. My sister had a black disc, and although it looked cool, it was not good to leave it out in the sun.\n",
      "I recently ordered several of these rugs and they are beautiful! Much better quality than I thought they would be. I will be ordering more of these if the price stays this low. I really can’t believe these are only 99 cents.\n",
      "I find the practical teaching in this book to be a valuable guide in dealing with painful verbal trials.<br />The understanding of the three different types of responses for the three different types of verbal assults offers a stability in learning how to respond in ways that are pleasing to God.<br />Being reviled we return a blessing.<br />Being persecuted we endure it.<br />Being defamed we entreat with the truth.<br />See I Corinthians 4:12-13.\n",
      "Once I cracked open The Accidental Medical Writer, I couldn't put it down. I loved reading about how these two writers started their careers in medical writing. Granted, the book doesn't offer a step-by-step blueprint to follow to become a medical writer, but isn't that the point? Both authors took circuitous routes to their ultimate careers and that's what they wanted to communicate with this book. Before I read this book I was thinking about doing some writing for free, but now I'm convinced to heed their advice and always get paid to learn something new, especially writing.\n",
      "Love the way how it breaks the fiber easily. I've got what I paid for and the reviews really helped a lot. Thank you!\n",
      "Joshua Nelson's book covers the entire science of Internet marketing from start to finish. While the guide is directed toward plumbing and HVAC companies, it can truly be applied to any business. Businesses that are looking to build a superb online marketing campaign including a fantastic website that is sure to land them on the top spot of all the major search engines. For any company that wants to escalate their call volume, increase sales, and grow exponentially, this is a must read! The book is packed with information, but broken down in a way that anyone can understand; it is filled with everything you need to tackle the world of virtual advertising with confidence and skill. I highly recommend Nelson's book to anyone looking to increase their bottom line.\n",
      "that I bought two. The spare is perfect for my big shop sink where I bathe the dogs. So impressed and happy with the quality. I would recommend.\n",
      "I needed a roasting pan very badly so I made this purchase. I typically don't buy cooking ware online so I was a little bit skeptical of whether or not it would be a good purchase. It came the other day by mail and I used it for the first time last time. It actually works really well! I am very pleased. I used it to cook a whole chicken and I put some slivered potatoes underneath it and doused the whole thing in oil and spices. It was very delicious!\n",
      "I don't usually go for refurbished items but this one is just an exception. I thought that it would turn out to be a piece of garbage but after using it , my thoughts were changed. I works almost like a new one to be honest.Its portable and easy to install. The pen is solid, doesn't bend or break. This should definitely get 5 stars\n",
      "You wash your vegetables, place them on the blade, pull the handle down and tada..magic sliced, diced vegetables. It is very sturdy, easy to clean and now my best friend. I highly suggest this item\n",
      "Was looking for a Bob Marley poster for a long time. This poster is great. I have it mounted in my living room, next to my DJ music system as I couldn't find a better spot for it than that. The poster itself is awesome and of great quality. The paper is nice and hard, so I can be sure that it will last for a long time.\n",
      "Description : This is one of the best products I have used on my dog to remove his tear stains. I love colloidal silver and this product has safe ingredients that work great.\n",
      "Great size and features. Over all very impressed with this little guy. I like how it comes with a multitude of attachments and it can be physically mounted permanently. I am going to purchase several more so I never have any dead batteries on my toys again!!!\n",
      "Awesome lights bright and looks beautiful, my bedroom looks nice, its a perfect product for my room what i was looking for.\n",
      "Great price and works great with my Canon 7D.  Products looks and feel strong. I highly recommend this product. I love it!\n",
      "Love the look, 42x optical lens, great price, and multiple function knob. Too bad Canon cancels the wifi, the 3&#34; screen is not so good compared with iPhone 6 screen.\n",
      "This set of knives is perfect for cutting cheese whether you are a connoisseur or a casual lover of cheese (and really, who doesn't love cheese?). The wide blade has enough breadth for “scooping” soft, crumbly cheeses, and the pointed blade will have no problem working through any chunk of parmesan you pick up. If you're cooking dinner for two tonight, prepping your meals for the week, or throwing a large party over the weekend, you will only need to buy one set of cheese knives, and this is it. While the set comes with a lifetime warranty, this guarantee seems almost redundant, as the knives are so sturdy that I can't imagine any of them ever falling into disrepair. Take it from me: I love cheeses of all kinds, and owning this single set makes me feel even more inclined to explore new cheeses, for cooking and for eating off-the-block.\n",
      "This is a very adorable and useful medical kit, specially designed for children. It has every common instrument prototype of a typical doctor. Children usually loves this kit.

      "I have 2 Miniature Pinschers who bark at the least little things. Recently we've shifted in a Townhouse so my neighbors are right next to me. When I let them out in the yard they immediately start barking. I have tried spray bottles, whistle, shake a can with coins and nothing stopped my Gigi and Coko. After tons of searching, watching videos, reading reviews, and checking consumer sites I decided to get this one. Since I did not want to buy 2 at once. So, I decided to try out one collar.<br /><br />So far what I like:<br /><br />+ As stated above, it produces sound and vibration in order to trigger. No painful stuff.<br />+ It's easy to set once you know how, but it's not intuitive. You have to take the time to read the directions to get it set right.<br />+ I don't buy batteries every week. I use a rechargeable battery in it.<br />+ It has 7 sensitivity levels. I prefer to use as low as possible because I want to give my puppy time to learn rather than a strict treatment.<br />+ Waterproof which is very important.<br />+ No problem with eating food.<br /><br />What I would like to see improved:<br />I would prefer at least one minute interval of intensity than thirty seconds.<br /><br />My puppy seemed very offended by this new system just the way teenagers don't like losing privileges. I have been using it for a week now. i am going to order another.\n",
      "This works really great, I usually decant my wine for a few hours before drinking it so that the true flavor will come out but when I got this Vinium wine aerator I tested it immediately, I poured a little on my glass and took a sip, with just one sip I could tell the difference! This works like magic! Thanks to this I can enjoy my precious wine anytime I like!\n",
      "I actually bought it for emergency purposes but I wasn't able to use it for 2 months so I was thinking how I can use them. Until my husband had thought of having a camping outside the house. (literally just outside the house) It was so cute when we did it and we are able to use it already. We used it with bed-time stories, when we are star-gazing and when we are playing hide and seek. It is such a helpful light. It goes with emergencies and also with plays and catch-up moments.\n",

      "[[VIDEOID:e096c59fcd48e0702a2acac1e74ca917]] The Flawless Fitness Strengthener is an overall great product. I like how it has different settings for strengthening your arms and hands at different levels. The size adjustments is also a great feature to the hand strengthener.\n",
      "This cover is well made, extremely functional and sturdy. It holds the 8&#34; Galaxy Tab 3 with a slip instead of the corner clips many cases have. I find this makes it more secure if it drops, and the only sacrifice is the covering of the border of the screen, which doesn't really matter to me. The black on black makes it unnoticeable. The design is just what I wanted, simple and functional. I also recommend the Invellop screen protector for added dust protection, especially if you take your tablet outside.\n",
      "This creation is grand, I couldn't wait for the shipping time, so bought it with some additional cash for same day delivery, People are complaining it that it was made cheaply and all that s***ty things and I can't understand what's the matter with these people, this is really a masterpiece.\n",
      "This is now my favorite pan. I have several pans but needed a new, study pan and this fits the bill. It is very heavy and holds up well to all types of cooking, frying, sautéing and simmering. Great, large all around pan with a sturdy lid. It takes a while to heat up but once it does, it holds heat well and does not require you to cook at higher heats. I don't think I have used the high heat setting once (electric stove) with this pan. Well worth the purchase and quite happy with it. Also purchased a smaller pan because I was so happy with this one.\n",
      "I think Bamboo has perfected or at least nearly perfected the concept of memory foam pillow. This pillow is just awesome! Soft and comfy. It also seems to help my slight neck pain every morning, cause I don't get them anymore. I definitely recommend this.\n",
      "Wonderful product and the main thing is that they stay on. I wear a very heavy winter boot and other traction devices always slipped off. Like I said, &#34;I can walk on water&#34;!\n",
      "Great book to point out what you need to focus on for studying for the exam. It tells you what you need to know and what you should look up. It is well organized and divided by modules which I found very helpful. I recommend it as a way to test your knowledge base and assess your strength and weaknesses by module.\n",

      "I have a little puppy, and he constantly barks non stop, my roommate is getting really annoyed, and threatened to make me re-home him, did some browsing on Amazon, found this bark collar. It's definitely wroth the buy, and it works, I was worried at first about the safety of my puppy, but after reading the description it's completely safe. He hasn't even barked nearly as much, and barely at all. My dog would slip out of all the other brands of collars, and He can't get out of this one, so that's a win! As he get older I can continue using this no bark collar.\n",

      "I bought this to doodle around a little bit on my laptop and I have to say this thing is frickin' awesome!

All in all this product is very good with its low price. Must have.\n",

The only thing I wish is that they connected to the Xbox 360.  In my opinion they are better than some other highly priced &#34;name brand headsets for pc gaming.\n",
      "A great bag that is made with quality leather material.

These are quite a bit better. I like the valve, which was a problem on the &#34;original&#34; because my Dyson wouldn't fit the valve. This valve is clearly made to be compatible with the smaller hose size. I've not seen problems with tearing or found the plastic to be delicate in any way\n",

      "Nine Kinds of Naked is a beautiful story, and Vigorito is a remarkable talent.  There is no scenario in which this incredibly intertwined story deserves anything less than 4 stars--and that only if you don't like an occasional smart-assed Socratic dialogue in the midst of your story.  I loved them, they're entertaining and thought-provoking as hell.  It's true, though, this is a thinking person's story, designed to prod the reader into an exuberant, expansive state of mind.  Haters gotta hate, but this is a story that truly rewards the reader.\n",

      "I am not the kind of person to leave a review, but in this case, I cannot help it as I am so impressed. As a fashion designer and a director with respect to the design and development of clothing, I have lots of experience when it comes to the performance and durability of stabilizers. With an extensive wealth of knowledge in this field, I know what works and what doesn't as far as embroidery is concerned.<br />I was testing a range of stabilizers from different producers and this product from Sew Artsy was among the products I tried. I could not help but notice this product as it stood out from the rest in many ways. It provided an excellent level of support for your stiches, I was so impressed with the quality of stitches I got from the entire process. Of all the ones I tested, this stabilizer produced the best quality as compare to other stabilizers. Even after laundering the cloth, the effect of the stabilizer was not diminished as it retained the desired attributes.<br />I had to convince myself beyond all reasonable doubts. I mixed it with other samples and gave it to my friends to test for me and guess what? The confirmed my discovery, as far as they were concerned, it is an excellent product. With a huge variety of such products in the market, I have finally found one I can stick with. Thanks to the developers of this product as this is a true product of ingenuity and diligent research. It is highly recommended to anyone who needs a stabilizer. I give this product AN ALL STAR RATING. I cannot help but keep lots of them for future purposes. This is definitely an EXCELLENT VALUE FOR MONEY. I no more need to settle for less when I can have the best.\n",

The sound coming from these speakers is crisp. The speaker has a tone control so you can tweak the treble. Plenty of volume even for outdoors. I wish there was a wall mount included but otherwise I have no complaints whatsoever. Nice product.\n",

I've found that it works well with this: http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B0002YRNJK  I'd forgotten how big these meals were! We cooked two of these (one for each of us) plus a side of MHM veggies; it more than filled my husband up and I couldn't finish mine. I had to pass my leftovers to our buddy who was camping with us. As for my husband, he was full well before he finished his but &#34;powered through&#34; to finish it.   As for the taste, it was delicious and a welcomed hot meal during our times in the woods.

One was the library at the University of Wisconsin in Superior, WI and the other was the library at the University of Minnesota in Duluth, MN. I spoke with about ten students in each library and asked if they could help. All of them said &#34;&#34;No. I thought that maybe from talking to the students someone could enlighten me about the benefits of the unit. Finally I did some research online that helped answer my questions.<br /><br />If I could give 4 1/2 I would have. It does what I'm looking for, it's not 100% perfect but it's pretty darn good!

      "Sensei Freedman has an incredibly inspiring story of growing up on the streets of Boston. This book does a good job to capture his personality and wit, and delivers powerful insights about the martial arts and some things to consider for becoming an ever-improving martial artist. He has a very scientific method for delivering martial arts lessons, and is very open minded and forward thinking, but adheres to and honors the traditions of the arts he teaches. A short, easy read full of great info that will remain on my dojo bookshelf.\n",

And now I just can't seem to take them off these gloves are so comfortable and so heat resistant that it makes me want to put my hand on fire!! I laugh at my friends moms all the time because their gloves get burnt unlike these... BURNT RESISTANT, the best gloves you will ever find.\n",

      "This is a very decent liquid stevia product. This means that it is stevia suspended in water. So, it is still a little bit diluted, but 1 drop of this stuff is still just as sweet as 1 teaspoon of sugar. I also like the fact that you can cook with it in addition to putting in with your drinks. Actually, I think that this form works better for cooking than it does in the drinks. In fact, if you primarily use stevia for drinks, this would not be the best thing to use. In that case try this one: [[ASIN:B00HQ99OUK Pure Stevia Powder (3.5 oz)]].<br /><br />Be forewarned that this is very concentrated. I would start by only putting in a tiny amount at a time. Then, mix it and take a taste to see. Believe me, a little goes a long way with this! Also, I find that this product does mix and dissolve very well. Plus, you may even find that it helps to boost your mood.\n",

      "This book is fantastic. You could probably read through the whole thing in an hour, but it's ideal for just picking up and flipping to any given entry. Most of the wikipedia entries are funny enough on their own but the comments at the end are great as well. Highlights include Frankenberry, which I will never look at the same way again after learning of \"Frankenberry Stool\", Codpieces in Star Wars and the Wing Bowl. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Taking this test can be rather intimidating, but if you've taken something very similar to the real test in advance, you might feel better about how you would do.  These practice questions have things in them that are very similar to what the test would have on it.  So when you take these practice tests, it will feel like the real thing.  You can then score yourself and see how you would do on the test.  If there are areas you need to work on, you have time to study those things before the test.  Knowing what you need to work on in advance is to your advantage for sure!\n",

      "I love that this cheese grater has more than the average different sizes of graters. The handle is easy to hold onto and the grater itself is very sturdy and not wobbly. The stainless steel isn't too thin. The graters are sharp and work perfectly! It fits easily in the dishwasher and fits nicely in my cabinets. This is a great buy and I will definitely be recommending it.\n",

      "I ordered these bags late Sunday night and received them on Wednesday. I have only used two of the bags so far but so far I Love them.  I love that. It makes storing use and keeps them clean and fresh until I need them. When I go to move, this will make moving easy. It will keep the items clean and together. The only advise I can give is to make sure you squeeze the white slider when closing the bag, I did not do that on my first bag and I could not figure out what I was doing wrong. Then I found the instructions and now every thing works out great. I thought I was going to have to buy 2 sets of bags but after I see how much I can stuff in a bag, I won't have to. I plan on using the leftover bags in camper to help with our storage.\n",

      "I haven't used the Müeller spiralizer a ton yet, but I am super excited about it! I initially ordered another, less expensive brand and ended up cancelling my order after discovering it hadn't been shipped 5 days after I had placed my order. The one reason why I chose Müeller over other brands is that I hear/read so much about how wonderful the costumer service is. I began to read reviews as saw that the owners or at least a representative for Müeller had answered a large majority of the reviews or complaints. That is super impressive to me. SO- I cancelled my other order and ordered one from here. It shipped and I got it 3 days earlier than I expected. So far- I am a happy and excited gal!\n",

      "Unfair is a fascinating read, exposing the inherent flaws that exist in our criminal justice system because of the inherent flaws of those that developed it, those who enforce it, it and those who it is intended to protect; in short, everyone.  The author uses real-life examples, cases, and scientific and psychological experiments to demonstrate just how susceptible our justice system is to human fallibility.  In one of the early chapters, for example, he uses the tragic case of David Rosenbaum, the award-winning New York Times journalist, to highlight how one mistaken assumption (that David was passed out because he was drunk - not because he had been struck and mugged, which was the reality) led to a series of oversights by police and medical professionals.  Once the mistake was realized, it was too late, and David died from head injuries.  However, as soon as his identify was known, as a respected and well -known writer, the biases swung in his favor - the perpetrator was identified, convicted and sentenced harshly.  Reforms to emergency and police procedures were passed in D.C., certainly tied to the victim's prominent and respected social standing.<br /><br />The book goes on to make sense of the seemingly irrational nature of false confessions; present the actual differences in &#34;normal&#34; and criminal brains; expose the predictability of cheating - from students to prosecutors; explore the unreliable nature of memory; discuss the obvious but oft overlooked fact that judges are humans, too! And the list goes on.<br /><br />I've never written a book review, but I felt compelled to do so for this book.  It is not only fascinating, but an extremely important subject that affects us all.  By educating ourselves about the science that dictates our every single thought and action, we can better understand how our justice system should be designed to ensure it can actually serve its purpose.  The book presents a number of easy first steps - some already being implemented - that can minimize the affect our biases have on the justice system - and also digs deeper, pushing the reader to grapple with the very nature of criminal behavior and how we as a society have been taught to view it.  I would highly recommend this interesting, enjoyable and important book.\n",

      "Earlier, it was clumsy to have the toilet brushes rested across the wall. By using Champ Grip, it makes the washroom look clean and organized! It comes with 6 screws on which the organizer stands, due to which it does not come off at any point of time. Also, all the brooms of standard sizes can be accommodated easily by this broom holder and organizer and I would highly recommend using this excellent product if you want to accommodate all the cleaning utilities perfectly in place without the chance of slipping!\n",
      "Ce casque d'écoute sans fil est si léger. Le fait qu'il est petit le rend très utile pour le prendre sur la route. Je l'utilise beaucoup avec mon iPod et MP3 à la salle de gym. La batterie intégrée rechargeable est un vrai plus et elle dure plus longtemps que celle de mon dernier casque. Le microphone semble cool, je ne l'ai pas encore essayé. Pour moi, c'est toujours le son qui compte et ces casques paraissent impressionnants!\n",

      "When I first moved out on my own, I had just a regular plastic (covered) garbage can – with a foot opener. Well after 2 or 3 those breaking, I just bought one of these, and can't be happier. A cool feature is that the inner can has a hole to poke the garbage bag through and hold it into place.\n",

      "I have never been to Kodiak Island; I don't own a gun; I don't own a bow: I have never shot a duck, goose, pheasant, wild turkey, deer or elk.  I am, and have always been, a city dweller.  My dad did not leave when I was small.  I was not raised by my mother and grandmother.  I am old enough for Sowers to be my son.  One would assume Sowers and I have little in common except our gender.  However, I like real stories about real people.  The stories Sowers tells are real.  Sowers is &#34;real.&#34;  He opens his heart and soul, holds nothing back; his fears, failures, shortcomings, doubts, thoughts.  He puts it all &#34;out there.&#34;  No, actually he brings you &#34;in there,&#34; into his real life, his real feelings, his real everything.  As Sowers permitted me to be a part of his private life, I found myself going in a different direction.  Although I started the journey in to his mind and heart, I found myself walking a different path, my path, my past, my life, my heart, my soul, my failures, my fears, my shortcomings, my questions, deep personal and spiritual questions. At one point I stopped, closed the book, meditated about what I have just read and wondered, &#34;How could someone so &#34;young&#34; have so much insight, wisdom and thoughts that are supposed to occur when you are my age!?  Reflecting upon the book, I have concluded Sowers had some help; divine I suspect.  Although there no &#34;preachy&#34; words or phrases anywhere in the book, make no doubt about it, the book is deeply spiritual.  It comes from a place deep within a writer who obviously has a genuine connection to the Source from which he draws much of what makes this book so special, so relevant, so personal and so vital.  I frankly think his book has something for every man, the best book of its type since Wild At Heart.  But this one will take you deeper within yourself than Wild At Heart.  I am curious to see how the book resonates with a the fairer gender.\n",
      "I have been needing one of these of a long time. This is a very nice grinder.  Much bigger than I anticipated, which is great.  It is high quality and looks really nice.

      "I purchased this dog collar for three of my dogs that I love a lot, but they bark terribly especially at night time. It was getting to the point that I wouldn't be able to get to sleep at night time so I had to do something about it. My good friend advised that I get a no bark collar, so I looked for online for one and discovered this one. This collar is effective, and until now I have no motive to think it has any negative side effects on my dogs. I can basically count the quantity of times they bark per night time now...if they even do! Thank you so much, because now I can rally sleep and wake up rested every morning!\n",

      "I love my happy hacienda confetti colors silicone baking cups. You can make muffins, cupcakes, mini cheesecakes, omlets and just about anything in them. You don't even need to use a muffin pan to use them. You can place them filled on a baking sheet and they won't open. They are non stick and you don't have to add a cooking spray on them. Once the item is cooled the food item comes out without a hassle. They are easy to wash and you can even use them in the dishwasher. They are microwavable safe so u can cook in the microwave in half the time. I can't wait to see what recipes I can come up with in them.\n",

I am also impressed at how easily it folds.  It rides very smoothly and our little guy looks really comfortable.<br /><br />This must be the best jogging stroller on the market. The only drawback for me is how expensive the basic accessories like a cup holder and snack tray are. But it should not stop anyone from purchasing this.\n",
      "The kids in our lives... my grandson and his 2 best friends.. all at the ripe old age of 11 seem to be mesmerized with spy novels, spy movies, spy toys, spy games, spy everything.<br /><br />When we were kids we played outside with our imaginations...<br /><br />These kids play spy games and have spy parties for their birthdays and it seems its all they want to do… for now...<br />We decided to indulge them and got this spy pen for them to use.

      "Super cute for my yard, I'm a huge fan of solar lights. I love the color blue, it lights up my whole yard, and I have sat outside with it completely pitch black, it's beautiful. The blue and yellow go great together, I have both in my yard currently. The solar lights last a long period of time, and don't burn out easily. My favorite mode is when it blinks the colors.\n",

      "I was so excited to get this coffee grinder.  It's a well made and design coffee grinder.  Really easy to use and maintain. The burr is made from durable ceramic, which the ground coffee won't have metal smell and will never rust.  The metal parts are stainless steel, which are durable too.  Another great design is at the bottle of the grinder there is an anti-slip silicone cover, which can prevent the grinder from slipping around and better delivering the force when grinding coffee beans. The grind adjustment nut inside allows you to grind coffee powder into different sizes (finer or coarser) Pros: Nice design Easy to use Made from durable materials (ceramic, silicone, heatproof glass, stainless steel) Easy to clean Can adjust the coffee grind I didn't find any cons yet.  My husband and I both really love this grinder.  Excellent product!\n",

My friend who himself is a wine enthusiast encouraged me to buy a good wine decanter to taste the difference. Indeed I did with this wine decanter. I almost went for a more expensive one but then I thought this one is reasonably priced but looks elegant nonetheless. Glad I've made this purchase!\n",

      "I will say the ages listed on the box are very accurate, due to the smaller pieces. My 6yr old grandson is OCD and took such extreme care digging out all of the insects. He really enjoyed this kit and was so fascinated with all the things we read and learned together. I love doing things like this with him because he loves to learn. After he dug out all of the insects in the kit, we went outside in search of bugs and insects. I have never had so much fun with bugs before.. I received this for my review and opinion.\n",

      "I will admit that I feel like I'm participating in cutting edge technology when I'm using this Muse headband. I have paired it using the Keep Calm app from the iTunes store. I have often wanted to meditate to control things like impulse, migraines, and anxiety but I have never been able to get to that state on my own. The Muse guides me through several different scenes (that increase each time I use it) that are actually enabling me to get into a meditative state! So much of our health and wellness depends upon the resting, re-energizing, and care of our brains that we never realize that we are missing until we are able to achieve these thing\n",

      "We will certainly never open another bottle of wine without having the right there! In fact, I will be upgrading my brother-in-law's aerator to the item soon too! This is a great product, well made and, well, impressive! I didn't know if I should believe it or not but this aerator really brings out the flavor of red wine. My girlfriend and I won't drink a glass without it. And if we forget and poor the wine directly in the glass we poor it from that glass into another using the aerator. This is my first so I cannot compare it to the competitors. Performs as advertised; it's an instant decanter, bringing out the best a &#34;red&#34; has to offer. Nice touch including a travel pouch, and tabletop base to hold stage it when not in use. Excellent product! Very good product, works well and is easy to clean.\n",

      "I had earlier bought Dr. Navadia's ECG Short Rapid Review , it was awesome and was searching some books related to Cardiology. I came across many books with more than 20 , five star comments..... Wait !!!! How can be that much feedbacks in a week and then rest of 6-12 months , not a single feedback ? All of which were self reviewed and so thought to buy this book after seeing Table of Content in it. Never go on feedbacks.<br /><br />And as usual , Dr. Navadia's book rocks ...I am a medic & i find this book explains every thing what a medic must know - It explains all relationships , drugs , non-pharm therapy etc . see table of content for more details.<br /><br />For common people, there is more than enough information which might be not usefull for them. DASH Diet is explained in short summary in 2-3 Pages (Go for detailed DASH Diet book if u want to move with it). So for them i would give 4 star for this book ...but for medics i will give 5++ star.<br /><br />In short , i would say , if u want to know more , go for this book , you will not regret your purchase , Thats my opinion... but if u just want to know only How to manage without doctors advice or only few things , then , better buy another book.\n",

I also love the removable zippered pouch--super useful for adaptors, cables, etc. Exterior-wise the case is really solid and durable, but that doesn't stop it from looking really sleek with the carbon-fiber looking finish. Add the handle, loop, and cool laser engraved carabiner, and this case is just really slick and well thought out.\n",

The straps are pretty long and if you don't fold them over or shorten them, your kayak will droop pretty low.\n",

You aren't going to find this high quality of a card in a retail store for any less, I haven't been able to at least.

Initially i thought this was a signal converter until i read description, it wasn't what i thought.I knew most people would have mistaken it for signal converter as well. If you want to use this transmitter cable it is best you get yourself a signal converter box. Not until i got myself a signal converter before i could use it. Now i connect without stress to my TV from the converter.<br /><br />Lastly, to avoid any damage its best you ensure both input and output devices are off when plugging or unplugging HDMI cables.<br /><br />Thanks\n",
      "First off I have LOTS more experience with my cheaper: http://fave.co/1c3BOHL  This thing is surprisingly bright. From a meter away, ISO 100, it gives a 2.8 split.  A rather peculiar thing is that to my eyes the 126 led light seems brighter. When doing a light check with my light meter, a nice sekonic digital one, it was reading half a stop brighter than the 160 light one. That's funny, more lights equal less power. I did a test right up on the light source and the f-stop at 100 iso was 16.3 for both of them. I assume for some reason the drop off is faster on the 160 unit. The 160 led unit does however have a greater spread, and considering the vignette this is an advantage because more area is flatly lit.  The reason I give this a rating 5 is because the color temp is off. It is too blue, slightly green. This is no surprise considering the price. It is also why one of the gels that comes with it is -green. But I feel that the gels that they give are too strong for cine work. The -green only needs to be a 1/4 maybe 1/2, not a full. Now skin tone is too red; a nice gesture at least. Another con of the unit is that it is obviously more bright in the center of the light and then there is an uneven vignette to the rest. This is not specific to this 160 unit, I also ordered a 126 led unit and have the same issue. You can easily fix this by reflecting the light or putting on some black foil, but built in barn doors would be a practical addition.  In short get the:  http://fave.co/1c3BPLM  This might seem like a lot of complaints, but for the price this is expected and still worth purchasing  I hope this helps!\n",

The point is here if you have larger than 30 sqft floor size, this is the tile you should look for as it is a large size basketweave marble mosaic and you dont use to much grout lines and makes it easy to clean and beautiful look on the floor. I dont recommend it less than 30 sqft area floors.<br />I had my contractor install them so it is professional touch into it. I really love the overall look.

      "I bought this last year, and have been used it for 4 events now. Mainly for christening, gatherings and celebrations. This camcorder is the best video recorder I have ever used. Why? because it's really great for low light and it has a great dynamic range. The footage with 30db noise is not that bad if you'll look at it on a big screen, I also love the batteries! You can consume the 16gb card at full HD 24p without dropping a single battery bar. The only negative side I found was the lack of shutter control, it does have a slow shutter but it's an automatic compensation. And hey! It has a 3 ring control for IRIS(aperture), Zoom(it actually has 3 zoom controls) and focus! Name the feature and it's there. This is better than shooting DSLR. In terms of picture quality, it's sharp, slow motion is smooth and great noise reduction technology.\n",

It was like a little miracle for her. The music is just enough to get her attention and the little bugs are adorable. The best part is that it turns itself off after about 20 min which is great because I always forget and she is usually asleep by then.

      "Tiny, easy to carry, but easy to lose too! No cap, but really none needed on such a small flash drive. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a strap or lanyard. This would be helpful to keep it handy and close by. High speed, trouble free with no intrusive software installed. Straight up storage drive.

Then when my best friend and I were watching the 20/20 special on the movie, she mentioned that it was her favorite musical. So, when I went to buy her a Blu Ray copy, I saw all the features this, THIS 50th anniversary version has on it. And it's AWESOME. If you're a fan of the movie, spend the extra bucks and get this 5-disc version. All the bonus features are excellent and thoroughly enjoyable. WELL worth the extra money.\n",
      "These pens are absolutely fantastic!  It works well with this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008G8G8Y?tag=i60-20  I had originally been turned on to these pens when I had come across an article showing that these Sakura pens had the best chemical, heat, and moisture resistance.  Found here: [...]  Ink stability is tantamount in a notebook for company or personal use. I can write with confidence knowing that my writing won't smear or fade and possibly lead me in a touchy legal situation.  I also really like the fact that the caps STAY on the opposite ends when writing, unlike some pens which don't positively lock on and fall off, eventually being lost.  My only gripe is that I'm often afraid of bending the tips of the smaller diameter pens.  I use these pens at work in labs to document my findings and observations, as well as to draw any intellectual property that may be used in legal disputes. REMEMBER, your word is only as good as your documentation, engineers!  Side note: A lot of the people who use the pens are incorrectly describing the sizes. The pen designation is a #005 and not it's diameter, not .005in, or 0.005mm. That #005 is 0.20mm in diameter, the &#34;&#34;#&#34;&#34; does not directly correlate to the pen diameter.\n",

      "This bag has it all! I love the design. I hate to rummage for things and this bag has so many pockets that everything has its own home and I can find it easily. The pocket for my laptop charger keeps it neatly tucked away, other bags you have to put it in with everything else and it makes the bag more bulky but the charger is on the side and not in the way. It seems very well constructed. I am very happy with the bag and would recommend to anyone.\n",

This is a beautiful and beautifully silent keyboard. In lowlight, almost dark, I can see the colors of this keyboard reflecting off his face, see his smile as he plays. He can customize the keyboard anyway he wants and it seems he changes it often, but he seems to love doing it.

      "The good: -Battery lasts more than 1.5 hours and it is more than enough for BOB to cover the whole place multiple times over -Great with dog hair -Always returns to charging station which seems to be an issue for some other owners based on the reviews I had read prior to purchase. We have a straight forward floor plan with a large rectangular living room/kitchen and two bedrooms on each end. We have put the charging station is the living room and Bob has never missed it! The bad: The kitchen table is Bob's biggest challenge (and my biggest annoyance with Bob). He somehow manages to get under there sometimes and tries to get out some other way to no avail. When I am not there, I don't notice the struggle and Bob eventually seems to gets out as I have never found him dead there. but if I am there, Bob's dumb moves and prolonged helplessness (I have even observed a 10-minute struggle once) get on my nerves.\n",

      "This is my favorite copy & printing paper.<br /><br />I've found that it works well with this:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BB5DJU6/<br /><br /> Georgia-Pacific was recommended to me years ago by a copier franchise owner. He told me it would not produce a lot of messy dust in the copier/printer as other papers do. I have been using it ever since. I have always liked the 5-ream pack-see GP Copy & Print Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 20 Lb, 5 Reams/Carton (2500 Sheets). It's convenient, but was not available this time with &#34;&#34;Amazon Prime&#34;&#34; shipping. In fact, the price was much higher (not being sold by Amazon). So, I saw these 3-ream cartons with &#34;&#34;Prime.&#34;&#34; Like the 5-ream, these are easy to carry, compared to the bigger boxes of ten reams. I have always found the price to be one of the best bargains. It looks like Amazon is going to keep it like that. One of my main complaints about having paper like this delivered is that they so often come &#34;&#34;beat-up!&#34;&#34; Then, you have to go through the whole process of returning it. What a pain! I think we all hate that! Right? What's the use? Not this time! These came from the manufacturer in a thicker than normal cardboard box which seemed to resist shipping damage. Hopefully, this is where I will buy all my paper in the future.<br /><br />Update: 4/5/2014 -- Almost a year later, this is where I have bought most of my paper since. I am extremely satisfied with this paper, the size of the box, the convenience, the packing (if you buy more than one box), basically everything! And, in all this time I have not had a &#34;&#34;beat-up&#34;&#34; box of paper delivered.<br /><br />Update: 8/27/2014 -- I have tried other deals on the 10-Ream Cartons GP Spectrum Premium Multi Use Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 10 Reams/Carton (5000 Sheets) that occasionally appear, but each time the office staff has asked that we go back to using this economical, very convenient and easy to handle 3-Ream Pack.<br /><br />Update: 2/18/2015 -- I tried GP Spectrum® 96 Multipurpose Paper at a good price. Still, I keep coming back to this best of all bargains in copy paper.\n",
      "The colours are accurate. And the quality is good! No smell. Came more quickly than I expected!Everything I've ever wanted in a leather bag. I had previously bought a cheap backpack for school here on amazon and of course it wasn't aging well.Good quality!I love it very much!\n",
      "It lacks content. This game, while fun, is just not worth full price.<br /><br />I hated my:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00KME8K9C<br /><br />No fanboy can deny that. Single player starts off ok before devolving into a check the block COD knock off. The arrest mechanic, while fun at first, gets repetitive since bad guys react the same way every time. AI is just awful. But hey, who plays battlefield for single player, right? Hotwire and heist multiplayer modes are great. Conquest mode is neutered without attack helicopters and tanks. Sure it's a cops and robbers game, but if you are going to throw in a classic mode than Visceral/DICE shouldn't have been so lazy about it. They could have themed it to allow for the fun stuff. After all, they have tanks and attack choppers in the campaign. The few 5v5 modes are not worth your time as Counter-strike does them better. There are a few balancing issues and bugs that need to be ironed out, but overall it runs well. There is hardly any destruction outside of levolution events, which kind of makes sense so that people may use the grappling hook and a few other gadgets, but it's still a disappointment none the less. My biggest gripe is the overall lack of content. EA promised us that Hardline would have the same amount of content as BF4. That was a lie. You only get a few guns per class. Take the enforcer class for example, you get to choose between 2 shotguns or 2 medium range rifles. If you don't like any of those then you are sh$% out of luck. Same thing goes for pistols and for some reason they are locked to certain classes. Why can't I carry a Beretta or glock in the mechanic class? It seems to me like they stripped a lot of content to later sell as DLC, which is what this game should have been... themed DLC. While I cannot recommend at full price, I do recommend it if you can get it for $30 or less. Or just skip it all together since BF4 is running great and better titles are coming out this year. At full price - 2.5/5 stars.\n",

      "This is one (or 3) of the few movies that I'd say is very long but will never get tired of watching even for the &#34;nth&#34; time. It's a multi-generational crime saga everybody should see. One of the best American films that has ever been created, I will definitely judge anyone who hasn't seen the trilogy yet. It's really amazing. Describing it as amazing would be an understatement. As for the restoration, it's a job well done but I still want to watch it in its original grainy copy. It just feels so real and nostalgic and mafia-ish and all. If you've seen the trilogy and actually liked it, I'm sure you'll also love Scarface, American Gangster, Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects.\n",
      "My son is crazy about construction trucks like crane trucks, bulldozers, excavators. When my husband purchased lego creator, my son just couldn't be disturbed. He'd play and pretend and he has his own magical world. I look forward to the time that he'll finally get tired of playing it because he has so many other toys too.\n",
      "I use this to display/store my scarves.

      "Citric acid is something that I always thought was a component of vitamin C. Was very interested in getting this and trying it out. Felt that with such a strong guarantee I really couldn't lose.    I have cleaned most things in the kitchen and the bathroom with this. Unlike many natural products, this is actually quite strong. Plus, it can also be used to help preserve food. I like using it on both vegis and fruits...makes them stay fresh at least a couple of days longer.\n",
      "These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00E9262IE  But they are the best I've heard in the sub $100 price range. Possibly comparable to these Sennheisers Earbuds http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B001EZYMF4  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00V3L7WME  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode and not stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00V3L7WME\n",
      "This is an ultra cool necklace. With a matching pendant like [[ASIN:B00GQPCKJW Black IP Cross with 24\" Long Chain by Talexia]] this necklace is unbeatable. I totally like the way it hangs around my neck. I fell proud and strong. I really really like this necklace.\n",

      "I bought this for my son who struggles with learning disabilities and sometimes low self-esteem. Well he loves this Gyro Hercules 'copter! The best part is seeing the smile on his face when he flies it. It seems to give him a sense of power and self-confidence. He feels in control of a situation,which he doesn't always. I bought this for him to play with, but we've gotten so much more from this 'copter than we ever could have imagined! My wife and I are thrilled!\n",

      "It works great. I just recently used it on a trip and it fit in the overhead storage with no problem. Also some people have complained that it doesn't have enough room for the spare rotors, but I didn't have a problem fitting everything in there. It worked great for what I needed it to do. The case is very sturdy and holds all of the equipment I need out in the field. The case is about protection and it does it well.\n",
      "I put this out on the front steps, its kind of like our guard-cat. He looks fierce and real (you can even see his muscles!), but he also looks wise and watchful. He has striking blue eyes that look right at you, and he could pounce at any moment. My little girls will feel safe knowing that Simba is guarding them (I told them it wasn't a lion-but they were set on a name from the moment I opened the box). I couldn't be happier with our fierce mountain cougar (or lion).\n",
      "This is a nice piece of equipment you can use at home to mainly exercise the chest, front shoulder, and back of the arms. It's durable, sturdy, portable, has great range of grips, and it's effective. I've had them for months now and use them quite frequently and they still are in good shape. These are very sturdy construction and easy to assemble. I strongly recommend Big Mike's push-up bars.\n",
      "This was a gift to my dad and he really loves it. He was amaze why I'm good at picking durable tools of a man considering I'm a girl. We'll this was recommended by my friend and heard good things about this sturdy set of tools and I paid off. My dad praises me like an angel. Awesome!\n",
      "This is the best set of makeup brush set I have ever bought for my girl. She loves the brushes a lot because they are easy to apply her makeup with. The makeup brush set has 12 brushes and it comes in a case. They are made really good so you don't have to worry about the brushes breaking when applying makeup.\n",
      "I bought this product to carry in my purse for extra security. I of course never intended to use it unless I needed self-defense but my husband, of course, used it like a toy\n",
      "I was very happy and impressed right from the start with the high quality feel and look of this knife! High quality metal feels good to the grip, a surprisingly ultra bright light for its size, nice fire starter that really works and shoots out good sized sparks. Although it is a bit on the small size but still effective. I tested it and it did start a fire for me. I don't really have much use for the window breaker and seatbelt cutter, yet. But if the occasion arises, it's great to know I'll be ready to help save a life. Altogether, I am very pleased with this knife. Especially for the price!! I think this knife is actually underpriced for its quality and all it has to offer. Just my opinion.\n",
      "perfect product for awning, RV, caravan. Flexible, dimmable and works well with all DC 12V power system. I completing the installation very quickly with hooks & velcro backing on the strip light. Love it!!\n",
      "If your good USA-made tools have wondered off over the years due to children, family, friends etc like mine, this set may fill a partial void. It has for me.  If you haven't already looked at this you should: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FLUB76?tag=i60-20  Something to beware of: Tool manufacturers to include those of flashlights are stamping items &#34;&#34;U.S.A.&#34;&#34; vs &#34;&#34;Made in U.S.A.&#34;&#34; due to some or most of a widget's parts/build process being performed offshore then in some fashion assembled in USA.  About the set: Heavy steel; lengths: 12&#34;&#34; OAL w/a ~2.1&#34;&#34; jaw drop, 9.5&#34;&#34;OAL w/a ~ 1.2&#34;&#34; jaw drop, and 6.75&#34;&#34;OAL w/a ~ 0.75&#34;&#34; jaw drop while closed; very good thick rubber-type handle coverings which actually feel thicker than my 40-y/o set (could be due to wear); exposed metal has some sort of heavy lacquer finish for corrosion prevention, something I don't recall on old set; water pump pivot pin is a big rivet vs lag bolt w/ self-locking nut...Hmmm, I personally like those w/ self-locking nut (older ones same size have) but perhaps the larger size pumps made today have lags/SL nuts, not sure.  The `apex' screwdriver is stamped &#34;&#34;CHANNELLOCK&#34;&#34; which means something in itself; has a 'corn cob' handle -- it's beefy by comparison and should perform well esp with longer high-carbon cross-tip bits.  If you're a picky B when it comes to hand tools, I think you'll like this set.  Update: Something's odd with screwdriver (shaft pulls from handle - I finally figure out lol). It has a reversible 5/16 inch bit (Phillips/flat) which has a receiver ball to remain attached.  And, apparently a bit with same type receiver ball (1/4inch bit) must be used on opposing side (ordinary bits fall right out lol)...hmmm\n",
      "As a father, i have tried many different night lights for my daughter trying to make her feel at ease at night. I love that it has an on/off switch, and it is bright but not too bright! It also changes colors that just fascinates my daughter!\n",

      "I have no technical experience it was very easy to set up and get real time video and control the camera with my i pad. The only trouble I encountered was setting up the alarm to take a snap shot and email it to me, but Roy quickly solved that for me by remote log-in.<br />This camera does a fantastic job and I will purchase more. I am not at home. If it was not for the great support by Kevin of Foolscap, I would have not gotten this done in a timely matter. He was fantastic. KUDOS to him!!\n",

      "I just bought this awesome starry sets of LED lights, from this seller as a friend recommended me to do so because I had been looking for them at big stores. I did not like what the stores where offering  they looked weak to me, and very low quality. I tried some and they stopped working after a couple of days, and had a too heavy battery pack. I wanted to use them on my bike, to light the wheels, and heavy is not good for that. But these ones I bought here, besides beeing unexpensive compared to the fantastic effect they provide, they are very lightweight, (good for hanging the battery holder on the bicycle), they give just the right amount of brightness for riding on it, the copper wire can be easily adapted to the shape of the wheel, and can be stuck to it with tape easily. I am very happy with them. I contacted the seller as I want more colors, so every kid in the family and my wife can use a different color on their bike. They don't serve them now, but in the future will do. I am going to wait for this brand, as I know for sure I will get a good quality ones. Can't wait to see the other colors.\n",
      "This product has many features and does everything that it has promised. I was having some troubles with my car battery and it dying. I didn't really know what to do about the problem and I wanted to have something in place just in case it would die. I used this when my car died and it was perfect! I can rest assured that this product will have my back no matter what happens to my car. I have also used this product as a phone charger. My phone dies a lot while I am driving and having this to charge it has really made that much more of a difference!\n",

      "Great short cables, they even come in pairs with mirror plugs so you can use on the side you prefer.<br />I bought it for FireTV stick, but I wouldn't have bought so many (one for each fire stick) if I new there were 2 on each bag, and specially if I knew it's only a microUSB to USB cable... of wich I have several from every cel phone or tab I've had for the last years... still - very useful!

      "Like all the other Lego games, this one is just as good. The story is obviously from the movie and it's fun to be able to relate to it. It's a great game that suit both parents and kids I think. On the x-box I play with my 9 year old son, and it's a really good game to be able to play together. The games goes on even if one of us has to drop out for a bit and it's easy to just join up again. Nothing is too hard in the game. Unlike other games where you can get stuck on levels, that doesn't happen here. I can't think of anything negative to say about this game. It's just a very user friendly game. A++++ Can't wait for more Lego games.\n",
      "Great addition for our camping trips equipment, the emitted is LED so that makes the power and quality of the light to be very strong, the fan is perfect for that moment in the night when you can't sleep because of the heat. I used it in our last camping trip with my son and it lasted all night long, which is great considering it is batteries what power this. It also is very lightweight which is something we were looking for, as we like to pack light. Overall, is a very useful tool for the camping amateurs like my son and I\n",

      "After my 12yr old water heater started leaking I bought this N-120 model. I had it installed and very happy with the purchase! We set it at maximum. During a quick test to get the air out of the system we turned on all the faucets. 3 sinks and two showers. All set at FULL HOT. The only one that didn't get as hot was the one furthest away from the water heater. I would recommend this unit to any one. I also freed up space in my utility room. This unit sits on the wall and I can now add shelving where the tank used to be.\n",

      "I searched Amazon high and low for the perfect case for my 7&#34; Galaxy Tab. There weren't any that looked good, were thin and lightweight and had a working stand. Then I found this case and I can't be more happy. I attend a number of meetings and needed a case that worked well while I use SuperNote Pro. Adaptive positioning with the case simple. The case is constructed well and my Tab seems to be well protected. Also works really great while watching movies on the airplane.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be a stylus holder since there is no room inside the case to hold my stylus.\n",

I have installed one on the back of the drivers seat and the other on the back of the passengers seat, they both fit and look nice on my Honda CRV. The best feature is the clip-in plastic buckle, it's so much stronger than the old verco one's I had. I will definitely be adding Freddie and Sebbie to my favourites list.

      "I ordered this mask recently after disappointment in several others. I am really pleased with it. The silk is very soft. It is lightweight on your face. It is not too tight and can be adjusted. It covers very well and does not allow light in. The elastic strap does not cause discomfort on the back of your head nor does it entangle your hair. I am a back and side sleeper and this mask doesn't slide around even when I toss and turn. There is nothing that I don't like about this lovely mask!\n",

They are durable, fit perfectly and the price was certainly fair.They fit nicely on a lower pole in the closet, so they don't take up a lot if space.I haven't had any fall off during use, so I haven't had to do anything about it. I would buy another set if I needed more pant hangers.\n",
      "My other son is 7, and I found picking up a splitter to be a great way for them to watch movies on the same tablet. This is the one I got: http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0044FSSMY  These headphones are an excellent value for the money. My son is around 3 and I have always hesitated putting headphones on her when she is on her Fire HD Kids Tablet. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00LOR524M  While this is the feature I wanted, if you are in a very loud area or on a plane that is fairly loud (small ones where you are close to engines), then they don't work the best. He sometimes had a hard time hearing the sound even with these maxed out.  These changed my thinking. I also chose these because they have the reduced volume feature to protect his hearing. I tried these on and had my volume turned all the way up and they were about 75% of the normal max volume. They are also fairly sturdy, I wouldn't be afraid of them breaking unless you actually tried to break them.  I would buy again, but be wary if you are only going to use them on planes or in high noise areas.  I highly recommend if you are looking for good headphones for your child buy these. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00503KPYS\n",

Well my normal mattress has been keeping me up tossing and turning not getting quality sleep. A friend of mine actually recommend this to me and I am so thankful she did. I have been sleeping like a baby and waking up refreshed...If you toss and turn at night I would highly recommend trying this out!\n",
      "The quality and taste of this green tea is phenomenal. I love making a cup of this tea for breakfast-- it is soothing and tastes good. It's also good after dinner, to help relax and de-stress. This tea is organic and non-gmo, carefully prepared and packaged. I really appreciate the fact that it does not contain pesticides. It is pure and clean, with a mild green flavor. I dont add any sugar or sweetner to my hot tea, although some people like it sweet. To create a frappe, I mix it with coconut milk and ice cubes in the vitamixer. Highly recommended if you like Green Matcha tea.\n",
      "This was on my checklist for quite awhile now, I finally got purchasing one after feeling sorry for myself at the sight of my withered Girbaud bifold. I feel leveled up with my new TH wallet, nothing jazzy with the wallet, just a well built leather one, with a very neat and imposing Tommy Hilfiger branding in front.\n",
      "A really fast and convenient way to grow fresh herbs. Everything required comes with the purchase. There is step by step instruction available on how to install it easily too. It is basically a self watering garden with a build in timer on the light. You can find other products that are similar but I think this one is nice looking, inexpensive, and works well. Have not had any problems this far and it does not looks like I would. I recommend it.\n",
      "I love the design of this product! It works great. I bring this wherever I go so no problem in charging my gadgets. It provides you a lot of power outlets. Also easy to carry. I think everyone must have this. Great product!\n",
      "It truly shocks me that people with labs (and other aggressive chewing breeds) think this toy will hold up with their dogs and then write bad reviews on it when it doesn't. Come on people, you know your dogs! If you have a strong chewer, you should know a plush toy like this (or ANY plush toy for that matter!) will never hold up under all the punishment and abuse their love of chewing and tearing will dish out. This is not meant for strong chewers and rippers. No plush toy is. So please don't trash this excellent dog toy because you made a poor decision based on your dog's breed.<br /><br />The fact is, this is a GREAT toy for light to moderate chewers. It's very well made and holds up great as long as you don't have an aggressive chewer. My Pembroke Corgi adores hers and spends many happy evenings playing with it. I love that it allows us to play together since I do have to 'restuff' the log every so often. But that's a nice way to spend time with my puppy and we both enjoy how fun this toy is.<br /><br />Honestly, this is one toy you can't go wrong with as long as you know your dog and don't buy it for an aggressive chewer. There are lots of tougher toys out there just for them!\n",
      "From last few days I was planning to buy a charger for my iphone. It is because my old charger was not working at all. In a word I have used my colleague charger to charge my phone. So having this one from amazon I was a bit nervous if it work properly. Now I am relived that everything is fine. My phone is getting charged via this Lightning Cable iphone charger.\n",

      "I was a bit worried when I bought this since it had somewhat mixed reviews, but I bought it anyway since the reviews were more geared towards the positive side. The main complaints I saw were durability of the chrome plating. I can assure you I've used this controller almost every day for 4 months now and all the gold plating is there.<br /><br />The only bad thing is that small surface scratches do show up, but that is to be expected with this type of finish. You ever have a cell phone LCD screen show small scratches that are barely even noticeable? That's what happened to mine, but they are minimal. It didn't get too many fingerprints on it.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, this held up better than my white controller that came with my console. My original white controller has worn thumbsticks (that are actually loose and have no grip) and the white controller built up a ton of dirt. This controller still looks almost as nice as when I took it out of the package. But then again maybe its because I kept better care of it since I love it so much :)<br /><br />Anyway, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone. It is durable, the mod is awesome, and the service provided by Geniusmods has been great. 5 stars in my book!\n",
      "This works well and has multiple uses. I use it to open some small boxes in the warehouse sometimes with it too.\n",
      "I bought this to make matcha lattes -- it's perfect!    I would highly recommend this matcha to anyone :)\n",
      "Doctor King's organic Japanese matcha is fresh, green, smells great and tastes very good. For anyone that is new to matcha, here are a couple of my favorite matcha recipes.  To make a matcha latte, I sift one teaspoon or two grams of matcha onto 8 oz of hot milk (160 F). I blend the matcha and milk with a hand blender and pour it into a latte glass. Sift a little matcha on top. Lovely! It has a light bright green color and is delicious! Sometimes I make matcha tea with this matcha - it's quite nice. Unlike some others brands I've tried, Doctor King's matcha is not bitter.  I love smoothies. Here is how I make a Matcha Super Smoothie. I use organic vegetables and fruit. I put a handful of organic spinach, one stick of celery. some cucumber, water 4 oz, ice 4 oz, organic Japanese matcha 1/2 teaspoon, one kiwi fruit, one pear, one apple and a couple of berries into a blender. Blend until smooth. Serve in a glass. I say &#34;drink it and feel super!&#34;  I have taken a few pics. I took the pics in a glass in bright lighting. I find that if you look at the matcha in a darker part of the kitchen or in a mug, you don't see the color so well. This product is a very good buy. It is definitely worth trying! :)\n",
      "I've always loved coffee but hated any side effects that came with it, so I was ecstatic when trying this out, and I have not been let down. It tasted superb, hands down the best coffee I've tasted, and it was easy to make and great to drink. It also really helped relax me while I was feeling stressed over work, so I think that this is the best coffee products I've gotten in my life.\n",

      "Bad ass overpriced staples they call premium which means it is what you should buy if you want your made in china stapler to work. Have to buy the expensive staples for your stapler to work. What has happened to this brand over the years? No pride in their quality what-so-ever.\n",
      "Ironic that it's meant for small areas/spaces (like mobile devices) because it's in a spot on the back of my desktop PC, and will be there for the time being. And it really is that small. I didn't see any indication lights - where would one be put - but it's working well so far. Keeping it.\n",
      "I purchased the InSassy TM Expandable 75ft hose because I just moved to my new place and there was a lot of lawn and trees to water, and I wanted something light weight.  Due to my surprise when I received the package, it was light and arrived quickly; I was already excited to use the hose.  From reading previous reviews, how the hose pops and what not, I read the instructions that came with the hose to make sure I didn't use it wrong. The instructions were easy to understand, which I liked since I do not want to waste time trying to figure out how to use to hose.<br />It has been almost 2 months since I purchased the hose from InSassy and it has been a great product, the hose does not kink, durable and light and it has cut my chores to half the time. I have a busy schedule since I have to juggle work, kids and chores; this InSassy TM Expandable 75ft hose has saved me a lot of time and money. I would recommend this product with 2 thumbs up. Thank you, InSassy for making my life easier.\n",

      "This is absolutely PERFECT for exactly what I wanted. In my very small space I don't have room for a file cabinet. I wanted a wall system to file my active project folders, and happy colors to brighten up the space. At the same time, it is relatively flat against the wall/roof so it doesn't crowd my desk space or my elbow. It is easy to access the folders and return them to their resting place, so it keeps my desk clear and my visual space (and mind) uncluttered. Then I can collect it into a compact package so I can carry it to a better heated space when the weather is so cold it gets too drafty in my attic office. Did I mention that my attic walls are slanted? The folders don't fall out. The material is a poly type, so someday I expect that the corners might get brittle an crack a little, but I imagine by then I will be ready for a bit of decorative change--I figure that's what washi tape is for. The colorful liners DO come with the system.\n",
      "Purchased 2 of these reels from FyshFlyer, one for myself and the other for my dad. Both of us absolutely love these reels!!! This is the best reel on earth. you can get any freshwater to inshore saltwater. I believe that their's no other reel that can beat it for the price and I even think it's better than some higher priced reels. You can feel the great quality, from the first click of the bail and the smoothness of the reel. These spinning reels, are well worth the money, knowing, they will last much longer, than any other reel, no worries this reel is simply amazing! I've owned in the past!\n",
      "The coolest gloves. Pretty useful & comfortable too. The customer service was very helpful. It wasn't clear if these are in men's or women's sizes.

      "As a professional, I have been using the Forecut-80i Plasma Cutter for 6 months now. And true to its claim, it is the best in the market. The powerful 220 volt 1 or 3 phase plasma cutter smoothly cuts most metals in a very effective way. The blow back pilot arc is one feature which I did not come across in other plasma cutters.\n",

The next batch will be perfect.\n",

After trying it out at first, he was surprised. After asking what was wrong, he simply replied : &#34;darling, you have never looked this gorgeous in a robe before.&#34; That made me feel so very special and aside from that, this robe really feels good on my skin. The material is so smooth and soft so it's impossible for it to irritate your skin. Me and my husband are satisfied and would like to give an honest recommendation to others.\n",

      "I was skeptical when I purchased this Chalkseries Chalkboard contact paper because I have already bought my fair share of disappointing generic chalkboard contact papers- the thin flimsy ones that don't hold chalk nearly as well as they are supposed to. However, I decided to take a chance with this one although it is more pricey than the generic  Con-Tact brand.<br /><br />As almost always with FBA, the items arrived within 3 days. The retail box looks amazing-  the company definitely put some great thought into it.<br /><br />I cut an 18 inches x 2 feet portion and applied this on my bedroom wall. I instantly realized that this chalkboard contact paper is different from the rest- it has a much thicker material (which later on I will find to be the main reason why this product is superior). I was able to apply it perfectly without leaving any air bubbles trapped underneath.<br /><br />After using this for 2 days, there are a few things I can comment on in detail.<br /><br />1. It holds chalk EXTREMELY well and when you erase with a dry cloth, almost all the chalk marks are removed. NONE of the chalkboard contact papers I have previously used comes close to the quality of this product.<br /><br />2. No \"scratch\" marks are left behind even when you do write hard.<br /><br />3. If you want to \"reset\" the chalkboard, wipe it with a damp cloth, and your chalkboard will look absolutely brand new. Not a single smudge will be left behind.<br /><br />In conclusion, I admit that it's obvious that I have nothing but praises for this product. I would give this product a 9.5 out of 10, only because I wish it was as cheap as the generic contact papers out there! But I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. When all is said and done, this product is DEFINITELY worth buying if you are fed up with chalkboard contact papers that are mediocre!\n",

      "First make sure you pick up a http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00CD8AFT8 It'll help a lot. Seriously, you pay this much for a laptop. Either that or get something like a http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00EEBS9O0  Cons: *There is a lot of flex in the screen directly in front of the keyboard. Very scary to grab anywhere on near the screen with any force. *The touchpad can be frustrating. It can't be used with games at all. Right click is near impossible sometimes. This is probably the worst thing about the computer to be honest. I am getting used to it, but really there isn't a way around this thing if you use it in your lap like I do. * No touchscreen. It would be better with one, but it's not really necessary. *Windows 8. This is probably just personal preference because it's totally usable, but I don't use the windows 8 homescreen in the least. I stay on desktop and that's it. *When I received the laptop, the top part of the screen was separated but clicked right together. No big deal. *I have noticed some scaling issues. Google Chrome does not scale whatsoever with the 1080p screen, so everything is very small on the screen. This is easily fixed by using Firefox, which scales perfectly. I'm not really tech-savvy enough to know why it does this (without googling...). Haven't had many more scaling issues other than with chrome. *All of the ports are on the right side. Someone may have an issue with this, but I don't. *The charger is a little difficult to plug in.  Pros: *Awesome display! 1080p is really beautiful on the matte screen. Works well in the sunlight as well as indoors and in the dark. *KILLER keyboard. I came from an older toshiba satellite, and I thought it had a good keyboard. http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00SXX975K Nope, this is what good is. The keys are perfectly spaced, backlit in red, no spacebar issues like I had read on other reviews. The keyboard is probably one of my favorite aspects about this computer. *Graphics card is good. I can't playSkyrim at ultra high quality with no lag whatsoever but it's good. *Huge amount of space in the hard drive. I really don't know how I'll ever use near that much. *The case is beautiful. *Huge touchpad *3 USB ports *The speakers are really great. I could actually sit and watch a movie on this, or play any game clearly in a crowded room if needed. *Wi-Fi works, I have had no issues at all connecting or having slow speeds. *Super thin and lightweight *Earlier Windows software can be easily used on Windows 8 if needed.  In the end this is a great purchase: http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00R45UGBC  I hope this review was helpful!\n",

But after seeing one of my students use an Nspire CX and its ease of use for graphing purposes I was sold to getting one. Now why get a CX CAS firstly its only a few dollars and you get a whole lot of fucntionality. the CAS is overkill for the lower level math classes as you will not be using many of the built in functions. But in higher level math such as calculus the CX CAS does everything for you, makes problem solving easier so long as you understand the concept. the CAS version does a great job at derivatives and integration, and allows for exact answers unlike that of Non-CAS versions\n",

Not because we have to or need to, but because we can. My husband was very excited about the tech aspect of this, so now he's turning on the light and turning it off when we're out to dinner, so it looks like we're home.

It comes with two batteries that seem to hold up a while. The charger also seems to charge the batteries in about an hour, which is definitely an upgrade from my ancient Craftsman drill. This drill is great for anyone looking to do home improvement, or like me, even on the job site. The drill seems to have great torque and my favorite feature of it is the chuck. I like being able to put a bit an and twist the chuck without it spinning (might not be a new feature, but my Craftsman lacked that). Overall, great value for a great brand. Recommended.\n",

I have had some different ones and my teammates have used a few other brands too.   So far I am very pleased with this HeartQ monitor.    I was pleased to see that it has all of the functionality I need on my long runs - like the tracker and calorie counter.  The last monitor I had didn't have the same functions.  Right now I'm in my level 3 where I'm exercising to increase my stamina. And when it comes to the function itself, they work great.  The timer and monitor alarm really help me to know whether I already reached the current activity level I desired.  It is very easy to use and to adjust the settings depending on my workout.

      "This is a must for anyone serious about getting professional level audio from their DSLR. Let's face it, the audio you get from a DSLR, even one with a 3.5mm input, is pure. Well, let's just say it is horrible. If you get this unit - the price is excellent for what you get and you have two XLR inputs for super clean audio by connecting a mic with XLR input or a wireless mic with XLR input. You also have an outstanding ambient mic on the front for great natural sound. The video cameras I work with all have built in XLR inputs - but DSLR's don't. This is a way to really make your DSLR a video camera too. I use this on a Sony A99 camera and it is great! You can also use this unit away from the camera, if you are shooting something at a distance, you can start recording on the unit by placing it close to the subject area and get great natural sound that way to.\n",
      "The Cozy Greens Potty Trainer is awesome and so much better than the padded ones you get in the store. I love the quality and the design is perfect for not cracking or sticking to it like the padded ones I have purchased before. We just started to train my 18 month old granddaughter and she loves sitting on the big girl potty but her arms would get tired and she would fall in with this she can sit up there and relax and won't fall in potty she is super excited to have this ring for this step in her young life.  I really like what the Cozy Greens potty ring has to offer:  * Lifetime guarantee * Smooth lines very durable and strong * Grippy safe anti slip ring * Potty training Ebook * Will not break, scratch, or deform like the padded ones that crack * comes with hook to hang for easy access * Donates some profits to charity  The colors are perfect I love the green and white, very durable and strong, packaged nicely for gift giving, fits perfect on the big girl potty to support and help in the potty training process. I highly recommend this potty ring for all those parents who are potty training. We bought padded ones from walmart for my grandsons because of the designs and cuteness and they hated them after a couple uses and wouldn't use they would stick to it and the padding would crack and hurt and little boys would have a hard time with the protector they had to climb over to get one and couldn't stick their private area down cause it was awkward. This is the best Potty Training Ring we have used and will not purchase any other than Cozy Greens. I did recieve for a promotional cost for my honest opinion and all opinions are mine own and we love it so does our granddaughter!!\n",

If your looking for a great backpacking bottle, or just a great all around NON LEAKING bottle, that wont poison you with lead, or other harmful contaminants found in competitors water bottles...this is without a doubt for you!!! Took backpacking to the Devils Den in Arkansas, no regrets!! Also notable: my water filter screws right onto these bottles! This made the usual tedious choir of pumping spring water almost fun!! These bottles are light weight, and very durable. These are NOT vacuum, double walled bottles, but extended cool/hot time frames, and sweating are not a factor for me!!! Great buy!\n",

      "I would certainly recommend this to those looking to lose weight or those looking to tone their core. Quite simply it works! I can tell you that this ab wheel is a good price compared to those in store models and its good quality, I have had no issues with it despite tons of use.<br /><br />I've been trying to lose weight for six months now and have made pretty good progress. As with any weight loss program it all comes down to eating right, exercising and supplements. Ive never been good at going to the gym so I decided to buy products like this so I can easily workout at my house. So my routine includes pullups, resistance band exercises, pushups and cardio. The cardio helps me to get in shape and burn fat, I usually do some sprints/intervals or some longer distance running. the exercise bands, pushups and pullups help to build muscle and define the muscle. And then the ab wheel helps with my core, keeping a strong core is very important in running as well as just normal day life. I work at a desk so ad exercises help a ton with keeping good posture in a very sedentary job. The ab wheel is NOT easy, I know some people may see it and think they wont get a workout but if you do it right and keep good form you will most certainly feel it. After the first few times using it I was sore for the next day! NOT easy. But if you want results thats what you need.<br /><br />On top of my current workout needs i have also been eating healthy. This healthy eating is mainly towards losing weight so thats the focus of many of my habits. For instance upon waking up I drink a protein shake and eat a banana for breakfast, protein is great in the morning when you are trying to lose weight. 30g within 30 min of waking up is ideal. In total I stick to about 2200 calories a day and try and stay away from processed foods although sometimes it is tough. I also take a supplement called [[ASIN:B00GA200WU Raspberry Ketones ]] which help you lose more weight by burning more fat and raising your metabolism. That combined with the protein shake in the morning help a ton. The protein also has the effect of keeping you fuller longer which helps me make it to lunch time without craving snacks.\n",

      "This treatment has helped me in so many ways. I have had so much acne, it runs in my family. I've had issues with it in high school, even now I have problems with acne as it is such a genetic thing for my family. I've always hated it. I could never look at myself in the mirror properly because of it. Now, with this it has treated my acne and I've been able to go outside, hang out and do my work without worrying about people judging my acne. Thanks!\n",
      "When I first use the device it keeps turning off after the lights flashes, the lights didn't stay on or anything. Then, I found it that it does not have a built-in memory and had to get a memory card. So, I bought a 16 gig card and inserted it to the camera and followed the steps indicated on the online manual since the manual that came with the camera was too small for me to read.

What I don't like is when you use cleaning cloths and they leave streaks and I love these because they don't leave any streaks and they don't scratch any of your surfaces.<br /><br />They absorb a lot as well, much more than I thought possible. What was surprising is that they can be washed and reused repeatedly, saves you some money on paper towels, if you use them.\n",

      "I am giving this DVR 5 stars simply because it does what it is supposed to do reliably.  I have tried almost every DVR that claims to do the same thing.  Let me tell you, the only other one on the market that comes close is the TiVo.  In fact, the TiVo is a better choice If you are looking for more features/bells and whistles and don't mind paying the monthly fee.  I also own a TiVo and to be honest, I like it better primarily because it has Netflix, but I think the DVR+ is a better overall performing unit and would choose it over TiVo and that's why I bought this one because I'm not interest in paying 14 bucks a month to have access to Netflix.  My Roku box does that just fine.<br /><br />I have owned it for several months now and day in and day out it does what it is supposed to do just like I was used to with my old satellite DVR.  The features are on par with most cable or satellite DVR experiences.  If you have ever used one of those this works just the same except for one feature.  This unit lacks the ability to omit repeats in series recordings.  I was told by Channel Master that this was designed this way because if you are not connected to the internet then the box does not receive the information from the broadcaster if it is new or a repeat.  They told me they had a lot of requests for this and looking into adding this capability for those users who are connected to the internet.  The only other thing I would complain about is the remote control.  It is not comfortable In the hand as most cable/satellite remotes because it is thin and the DVR playback buttons are on the bottom of the remote making it a two hand process to jump commercials.  This is not a deal breaker though, you get use to it.  And if you can't get use to it, a universal remote is always an option.<br /><br />If you own an antenna and want a DVR that works like the one you use to have with cable or satellite, the DVR+ is the best bang for the buck.  The other units on the market just don't stack up the same.  Some do not include a remote and require a tablet to control (cumbersome!), others only have a single tuner so you can only record one show at a time, none have an on-screen guide as robust as the DVR+ without paying a fee and last but not least they are not near as simple to use, at least the several different units I have tried.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that I have already had two software updates in the few months that I have owned it. (Yay!  They are making it better).  Plus I have been told that the have a whole slew of internet content coming later this year.(Will see if that pans out)<br /><br />If you want a reliable antenna DVR without monthly fee's, this is the one to buy.  Don't waste your money on others like I did, spend a little extra dough and buy this one.  In the Antenna DVR department, you truly do get what you pay for.\n",
      "As soon as this arrived I had to try it out.<br /><br />I hated my:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00NGKLBKO<br /><br />I packed it up with my usual travel documents including Passport (which there is a nice spot for in the back half) payment cards, phone card and some foreign currency ( which fits perfectly in the front zippered section). I put it on to see how comfortable it was to wear under my jeans and forgot that I was wearing it until I got ready for bed. The fabric has a nice feel, unlike others I have used before. It would also be the perfect gift to give someone who is a first time traveler. I take groups of students to Europe and always require them to wear a money belt. This one is great as you forget you are wearing it until you need something out of it. I like the fact it has two zippered sections as well. It also has an adjustable strap so it should fit most sizes. The strap feels solid and should hold nicely and not stretch out as the less expensive ones I have used previously do.\n",

The array of tools in the handle, while not for primary use, will serve well when I'm in a bind and need a tool I otherwise would not have. The scissors are especially useful, and screwdrivers and knife are always handy to have around. The seatbelt cutter is quite sharp yet safely shielded, and the glass hammer looks like it would do the job. A hefty point flips out of the side of the handle. Holding the light backward, it feels like a hammer ready to take out a car window.\n",

After buying one of these tuners with a guitar I bought recently, I was pleased to be able to easily tune my own guitar. I then bought one to my 13 year old daughter who is learning to play, and now she can tune her own guitar after her little brothers mess up the tuning. The piece clips onto the end of the neck of the guitar, in between the knobs. All you have to do is pluck a string and the tuner quickly identifies which string and tells you whether the string is sharp or flat or perfect. Great little tuner and very accurate!\n",

      "I have had issues with brand name ink in the past. Either my printer wouldn't recognize it or it would work for a little while and quit. My husband made the decision to purchase this set.We have already used 2 full cartridges with good results. This is a good brand.\n",

      "My dog used to lose hair at a fast pace and the hair would be scattered all around my place. One of my friend suggested me to use RX4 Pet Shampoo on my dog. Within a month of usage, my dog's hair became soft and shiny. It now looks healthier and my dog looks much more comfortable than before. Also, this shampoo is organic which is the best advantage it has over all other shampoos available in the market. I will definitely purchase more once this bottle gets over. Best solution to ensure hygiene and health of your pet and make it feel better.\n",

      "I got this elliptical as a replacement for a different elliptical I bought here on Amazon and had the worst time with. The first thing I noticed with the first elliptical was how cheap the plastic parts were on it with it costing that much money. I felt as if I paid for something that should have been way higher quality. Also, it would shut off randomly without any notice or true reason. It didn't matter where I plugged it in, it would still do it. Overall, I just wasn't happy and regretted buying it.    If you are thinking about getting this elliptical, please think again -----------------> [...]    I absolutely love the Schwinn 470! It works correctly and feels like it is built with care and built to last. I have owned it for over a month now and can't find a single thing to complain about. Clearly, I should have gotten this one to begin with.    I hope I am able to keep others from making the same mistake I did and just get this elliptical.\n",
      "easy operation,  it hangs and records upside down which really doesn't matter. Only drawback so far is when using motion activated mode, it only records the first motion it finds and then turns off. So I just let it run until it runs out of space on the microdisk or runs out of battery\n",
      "These are nice and sturdy boards, great for painting signs and inexpensive study art. Thick and strong enough to drill holes in for hanging wire.\n",

      "I have been searching for a good set of headphones under $100. My first try was with Sony MDRZX600. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B007BY3POQ  I went to Bestbuy set on getting the Sony V55's. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B007BY3PNW Luckily, they head these right next to the V55's. After spending about 15 minutes listening to both, I thought the low's on this one sounded better and the headband had more padding.  They sounded very warm and were great for high's and mids, but the lows were lacking and you needed to listen on full volume for them to sound good. I decided to return them and try the Sennheiser 439 but the volume was too low and that was a deal breaker. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B005N8W1TM  I brought these home http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S749IQ8 plugged them into my Nexus 7 and I couldn't believe how great they sounded. TI listened to Bob Marley Legends album and these head phones sound incredible. The bass is tight and pronounced, but not muddy like the Dr. Drye's I'm very happy with these and I'm very glad my headphone hunt is over.  In summary, Pros: + Great frequency range with deep, rich bass (5 Hz to to 22,000 Hz) + Very comfortable earpads (more comfy than other more expensive headphones I've tried) + Does not make my ears sweat, even in the summer-- a very pleasant surprise + Vibrant color options/ slick design + Wires are tangle resistant (although they are &#34;spaghetti&#34; style for those who care) + Lightweight, and fairly comfortable even with long use + Aesthetically pleasing + Price is decent + Great sound quality for price  Cons: - Plastic build- not cheap feeling but worth a mention - Sound isolation is average, adequate for cafes/ dorm rooms but unsuitable for city/airplane use unless you really crank the volume - Seems to be some some sound leakage at high volumes - Noise reduction, while good for supra-aural headphones, isn't as effective as its circum-aural competitors. This wasn't a big deal to me, but itmay be for some people. - Cord is a bit short (1.2 meters) for some applications (In my case, use with a desktop computer)   All in all I now recommend these to all my friends http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S749IQ8\n",
      "This is the must have product of the year.  When I traveled this last weekend I used this in replace of my purse and Wow, it was awesome having all my important papers and Id and credit cards all packed into this sleek little pouch and all was safely carried around my neck and no one could steal it and I could not lose it unless I took it off around my neck.  This made my traveling a lot easier and stress free. It kept everything nice and tidy now only if I could do that with the rest of my life!!!\n",
      "This is the second Koi we've purchased from Design Toscano for our Koi pond out front. We wanted some company for the orange Kohaku Koi. This one is very pretty, I like that there's a sort of reflective hue of blue in the scales, looks great against the water.\n",

      "These oven gloves by EKSEL are perfect for oven grilling, barbecue, fireplace cooking, camping and all similar purposes. They provide supreme heat resistance and are really comfortable. The grip is also very tight and not slippery at all. The package also came with a free bonus bbq recipes book. I am glad I got to try this product, and I was really satisfied with it.\n",
      "This tape is really worth buying, I have used it for multiple purposes i.e. cables and box sealing and worked perfectly. It’s a top quality product having a very low price. Those who are using other products must give it one shot, hope you'll like it as well.\n",
      "Bed Bug patrol cured my bed bug infestation.  I was getting rashes for abour a week.  I kept spraying my beg with this bug killer, same with the furniture in the living room.  In 3 weeks, my bed is bug free.<br /><br />My dog did not even have any allergic reaction to the spray.  I also solved a mild ant infestation with this spray.  Its truly wonderful.\n",
      "I want to give my thanks to one of my friends first, who recommended me to buy this travel case.<br />I am very pleased with the small case, and it does just what I hoped for a long time which allows me to place a series of connectors in my case for various reasons. cables with USB connectors, and pin connectors, and any number of other ones.<br />The Dimensions is L6.5&#34; x H10.2&#34; x W2&#34; and weight is 0.73 pounds. Very easy to carry out for your convenience.<br /> I'm able to store different other connector tips in the mesh portion, and that portion zips. So, I will recommand it to some of my friends and I believe you will love it after buying it.\n",

      "This product is awesome. Sparky had a habit of barking all day and night. He barks at every and any thing. It was very annoying and disturbing. I started looking for a solution and found this amazing and effective No Bark Control Collar. I can finally enjoy quiet moments while at home. The customer service was great and the item was also delivered on time. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "This TASK Stool is a Godsend! A serious back problem recently incurred prevents me from standing for more than 5 minutes! BUT, now, I can scoot around the kitchen at various heights, accessing microwave, countertops (the stoolis adjustable), as well as cook top! Something I could NOT do prior to purchasing this item! Soooo glad I thought of and purchased this handy-dandy wheelie! But, wait! My Dentist was my inspiration! I must remain HONEST!\n",
      "Best Trimmer to trim the Plants And Flowers. Very Sharp stainless steel blades helping in giving proper shape to plants. It is very Adjustable so easy to use and ensures proper safety. Highly Recommended this Product to small producers to save their valuable time and efforts.\n",
      "It is one thing to be a fan, but life is better when others know who you represent. This Ohio State koozie not only allows me to hold my beer can steadily, but express my team spirit in this year's national champions. Do not have to worry about them getting saturated with the can's sweat and it seeping through the koozie wall either.\n",
      "WOW, these mats have made grilling so easy. I ran into them by accident when I was browsing on amazon and I love them so much. I no longer have to deal with foil and I am glad.\n",

      "Great painting.. I've now purchased a few paintings/artwork from them and they've all been perfect. They all look exactly as they do online. Lightweight and easy to hang. Good quality. I have this painting hanging above our tv in the living room and if looks great.\n",
      "This is so far, the simplest camera to set up and begin remote viewing on the phone.It only took 5 minutes to set up, quite simple. Work good even in dark enviroments.\n",

      "This cute bouncing cow brings joy to our family. My son love it so much that he plays everyday. It comes with a free pump and convenient for me. Well thought by the seller.\n",
      "This is the best ever meat shredder i ever use, i can easily shred my pork without even making my kitchen messy and its very easy to use. I felt im a big fat bear with a claw using this,hehe. My mom saw me using this claw one time and she really laugh at me says im cute on this one. But she was amazed that my kitchen is not that messy when it comes to pork shredding. This claw was so easy to clean too!\n",
      "I was a bit disappointed in how these thermostats had performed in my apartment complex.  My HVAC  tech recommended I try the new Nest thermostat because they had worked out all the kinks that were wrong from the other ones. I was a bit skeptical about using another Nest thermostat, but I trusted my HVAC technician because he always did good work for me. So we switched out the old ones and replaced them with these new ones.<br />What I like most about these thermostat is they are easy to install, and the wi-fi is easy to set up. These have air-wave technology so the compressor shuts down at the appropriate time while the unit is still reaching the desired temperature.  The auto-away technology allows the system to shut off the AC within a specified time frame when the unit senses no one is at home.  All this does is make both me and my tenants happy because they save on utility costs and tend to be more faithful in paying their rent on time with no complications.  For this, I'm convinced this was the best investment I could have ever made for my properties.\n",
      "great for the value and very adaptable. The price is low but quality is pretty good. Happy to deal with the seller.\n",
      "I love this compact saw.  It works really well as a travel saw, and I can see  this being used as a survival pack saw if I had to go hiking or camping.  It comes with it's own nice pouch that makes it easy to throw in your camping or hiking bag. It's lightweight and easy to handle.  It does an excellent job of cutting through wood like it's paper.  If you're cutting up a fallen tree, it could be used by two people to shorten the time.  Just keep in mind that the rivets are very fragile and will need oiling prior to the first use and after each use to prevent the blade from rusting and breaking. I am definitely sold on this one.\n",
      "This silver grey tie is very stylish and has a textured feel. It is a gift for my husband for anniversary so I can't comment on how he likes it yet, but I am impressed with the expensive look and feel. Will buy more ties like this in the future.\n",
      "I need knee surgery, I have had one already. With this knee brace/support my knee hasn't hurt. It keeps it protected and doesn't fall down. I really like how the middle strap keeps my knee in place. As always veluxio has outdone themselves. Quality is outstanding, top of the line workmanship. I think this is one of the best braces I have used.\n",
      "The candle needs to be taller for the oil to really warm up but that's a minor inconvenience for such a pretty and functional product. It's pretty neat!\n",
      "I love the classy look and feel of the case.  Easy to use.  I don't bother to take off the clip-on part when I'm taking isolated shots, and just slide it easily under the camera while still attached on the two side clips.  Maybe I will take it off if I have to use the camera for a continuous extended period of time.  Currently, the brown version has a mold that does not allow access to the side ports for connecting to a computer.  You have to take the case out if you want access to the ports.  If this is important to you, the black version of this excellent MegaGear case does allow easy access to the ports even as the camera case is installed.  If this feature is important to you, you might want to choose the black version until MegaGear comes out with a similar brown version.    In any case, I'm very happy to have bought this case.  It protects my pricey camera well and makes handling the camera more pleasurable.A nice bonus is the soft black velvet pouch that comes with the leather case.  It protects the case when you put the camera into a bag while travelling.    The case also comes with a leather strap that you can use over your neck or shoulder.  I prefer to have just a hand strap, so I don't use this neck strap or the one that originally came with the Canon.  Instead, I use half a shoe lace tied together to form a hand strap.  Makes the camera easier and less bulky when carrying around.    I'm very happy as well with the wonderful MegaWest customer service when I made queries to them.\n",
      "Although they do run a little small, they are the most comfortable slippers I have ever owned. They are so nice!\n",
      "These earings are so pretty!! Very elegant!! I recived these 2 days ago. I was shocked how they looked in person!! I'm in love!! I would love to get the whole set!!\n",
      "These are classic old school but cool shades. If you want to pull off the shop teacher look, just give these a try and you have it!\n",
      "This is a great product. I've used this for the past few months and worked like a charm. Even though it is a compatible, you would not know the difference. For me as an accountant I use it to print tons of tax returns business and personal and it does the job wonderfully. quality product.\n",
      "This is an pretty good bottle warmer. However, it has a timer and auto-shuts, but there is no alarm to tell you that the milk is ready so it's very easy to burn bottle. I used this with many different types of bottles (e.g., Advent, Playtex, Dr. Brown. etc..) and it works for all of them.<br /><br />I would prefer the Dr Brown warmer below which has certainly more features<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035LLG2W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0035LLG2W&linkCode=as2&tag=derdigki-20\n",
      "This jump rope is super fast! People keep asking me at the gym where I got it. It is great to have the pouch as well, I can keep it in my gym bag and have it handy whenever I need it. It is also super easy to adjust. Love it!\n",
      "i honestly like this phone, in particular this one because it has caller ID so whoever calls you their number will appear in your phone even if you don't have them as a contact, so basically is will tell you whoever is calling you, only blocked numbers will appear like always.<br /><br />i also like this phone because the numbers are pretty big and the reason why i like it is because in my house there is my grandma and she can't really see normal size numbers with naked eye, with all the other phones we had she had to use her glasses all the time because she is constantly calling family and friends because she has nothing to do.<br /><br />now she doesn't need her glasses every time she is going to call someone, and other thing i like about them is that the base is pretty simple and is not that confusing like other house phones do.<br /><br />i would recommend it to everyone!\n",
      "This knife feels really solid! I am really happy I came across at this price because I feel it should be listed for more. The spring makes the blade shoot right out unlike other spring “assisted” knifes where your finger has to do most of the work. The digital cammo gives this knife a very masculine look and that's one of the reasons why I bought it. The handle is great and feels very comfortable. This was definitely made to last using high quality parts. I have cut everything from metal wires to rubber and plastic and the blade still works great. Definitely would recommend!\n",
      "These cords are pretty straight forward. The video, audio, and internet work flawlessly. The cables are somewhat low profile, and easily hook up to the back of my TV. I like how it was a two pack for my TV and video game console. Overall, these cables are exactly what I would want and expect from an HDMI cable, and you can't beat the price.\n",
      "These hoods are so freakin adorable in person! Both the fur on the inside and out are fairly soft and can more than likely be easily hand washed if necessary. There's soft side pockets for your hands (or phone, wallet, etc if needed). There is also a button at top to keep your hood on and a zipper pocket for more storage use. These are super handy if you don't want to wear a small bag to an event or for just staying warm. XD\n",
      "Great buy! perfect for male or female, very fun to see sonic roll around on his skateboard. very easy to control very fun for the whole family.\n",
      "Really useful for camping. Brought this when we went to the mountains for an adventure. You don't have to use this when you're in the city though. It would be too impractical.\n",
      "a little goes a long way with this matcha powder unlike other brands I've used before. It's very delicious too and does not have any bitter after taste. Perfect for my daily smoothie and from-time-to-time hot green tea latte. Great quality for the price. Just think of all the benefits of matcha and you'll be amazed.\n",
      "It's incridble. Seriously. It's durable and the sound quality is amazing. Not to mention the colored light pads and the stand by light show. It's the little things and this has a place in my heart now.\n",
      "Now I am satisfied. I tried a lot to make a link between my android and HD TV but got no way. Now I can use both the devices and getting highest satisfaction.\n",
      "This bag has quickly become my favorit. Its built material is high quality, and the design is amazing. You can carry it anywhere and it is spacious. You can fit a lot of staff in there. I have literally worn many types of different objects in it, from clothes, to heavy objects like books and big water bottles. It is very durable and it fits with any type of sport outfit. Great bag that I recommend to anyone.. it can be your travel, shopping or sports bag.\n",
      "Have to say that this was one of the best teas I have tasted. The lightness and balance to it was amazing. Later, I learned that this is actually only harvested in a specific region of China for a very limited time (like a few days a year). It has almost a nutty and sweet flavor to it, so it might be a bit different than what you have been used to.<br /><br />This can certainly provide some needed variety from time to time. Of course, the more traditional and full-bodied black teas are probably more mainstream. This version of Earl Grey Grey creme is one of the best I have found anywhere: [[ASIN:B00HFMS74C Organic Black Loose Leaf Tea: Earl Grey Creme 4 oz. + FREE Bamboo Tea Strainer]]<br /><br />This is also a good place to start for those who do not to go in for an overly heavy tea, since it does have some fresh citrus notes before its full flavored finish.\n",
      "It was easy to install and worked like it was supposed to. I love it and I would recommend it for purchase.\n",
      "I am not exactly an outdoor type girl and the thought of having to light a campfire myself is somewhat intimidating. While looking for helpful camping tools for an upcoming girls trip, I came across the Fire Lighter Spider. I bought it on whim but was skeptical since like I said  before, this is not my forte. I tried this on my patio first to make sure even I could make it work, and it is amazing. It is almost impossible not to get a good campfire going with the spider. I highly recommend this tool to anyone from novice campers to serious backpackers alike. This is time saving and easy, even in the dark!\n",
      "Smaller size but gives off bright light.<br />It takes three AA batteries.<br />You turn it on and on by pulling it open (up) and off by closing (down) it<br />Its water resistant<br />I highly recommend this lantern\n",
      "It is a very helpful awesome product for your loving dog. You can adjust the settings to alter the timing intervals of the shock, as well as the strength of the shock. highly recommended...\n",
      "i really like this gun and buy it for my friend son he really like it  and thanks me a lot for this gun!! highly recommended to others..no problem with this gun!\n",
      "I've used other grip tips that were thinner but I really like the extra thickness you find with Dava. It is thebest grip I've used. Even if your fingers get moist, the grip is solid. Dava makes a great product.\n",
      "This is an excellent product. Very soft and great quality. The baby is able to hold it herself without any problem. Getting it back into her mouth by herself is easier now. Great purchase!\n",
      "This is the best set of gloves that I have used for welding not only because of the many features that it has but also because of the functionality that it provides.  It is very comfortable to use which allows me to be more efficient when it comes to my work.  It will also come at an affordable price which is very important for some professional welders out there.  It is also made of high quality leather that you will definitely find easy to wear and use for a very long time. Overall, I will give this product 9 out of 10.\n",
      "I recommend them over dymo labels if you want to save money and still have working, quality labels. They worked just fine for me. The white color on this label is pretty bright so the text is clear because of the great contrast. Overall very good.\n",
      "I own Roku 3 and Apple TV, Nexus player from Google and the Amazon fire box. For what Im looking for the Q is the only box that does the job the right way without hassles. I have had nothing but problems with the apple Tv from having the jailbreak this thing every month I just gave up on that. XBMC runs flawlessly on the Q and I havent had to do a thing to it. Just run and it works and I mean everything works. All the content I add to XBMC on here plays perfectly. Even the apple TV jailbroken wouldn't play some of my collection. The Nexus is closest but has problems with some MKV formats in XBMC. The Q is by far the most compatible device I have used for throwing any kinda media at and never flinches. It just works. High regards from me for this box and highly recommend for anybody that doesn't want to worry about if their media is going to be compatible or not with the box they own.\n",
      "My son absolutely loves this teenage mutant ninja turtles toy. It mixes two of his favorite things TMNT and cars. It seems like he is always playing with either the motorcycle or the actual action figure. He has a ton of fun with it. I would ventrure to say it is one of his favorite toys.\n",
      "Have had a great experience with the robots so far. The apps are cool, and my daughter loves playing with Dash together with her friends.\n",
      "Before trying to wear this on your bike/run/jog, fiddle with the instruction manual first; it will save you a lot of time and frustration. Once you figure out the settings and watch capabilities, you will be impressed with it.-It can calculate running speed, distance, work out time, and much more with accuracy. I also love that it comes in a handful of colors. I got one for my partner, since we do our workouts together. Helps us monitor our progress and easily maintain a fitness regimen.\n",
      "I absolutely live this, I had a big problem with my dogs barking when they where outside and it was really annoying my neighbors.  So finally I found this and figured I would try it and since I have had it my dogs are quiet when they are outside now and my neighbors like me a little better now that dogs don't bark.  And the birdhouse looks cute hanging on my tree.\n",
      "Frito-Lay is my family's brand of choice . This chip mix comes with a perfect variety and came fresh as always . Can't say enough good things about this brand ! We love them!\n",
      "Great shovel. It gets the job done. The point works well tearing through the ground - dirt, grass, weeds, that occasional rock or 20.\n",
      "My daughter and I made strawberry smoothie with this we used almond milk in place of the water they were really good\n",
      "Hi, I bought this for my three young sons and we wanted to give you my feedback on the product.  I was really impressed with the quality of the toys. As soon as I gave my sons this set, they fell in love with it right away. It makes them think that they are their dad and they love to use their imagination to create projects and use the tools that this kit provides to accomplish them. I highly recommend for this set to any parents to buy it for there sons.!!Thanks!!\n",
      "very fun for the whole entire family. Can fly indoor or outdoors if you prefer. Battery last for quite some time. very educational for the kids. i have this for almost a month now with no problems.\n",
      "I purchased mine from Zeldabelle.com so I can't comment on Amazon shipping speed... but if you're Amazon Prime member you know how great it is. However, I wanted to share how much I love this product! I got it for my son's 3rd birthday. He loves it!<br /><br />It was very easy to set up. You could do it by yourself but would be easier for two people - it took me and my friend just a few minutes. All you have to do is assemble and insert the rods into the rod pockets and tie it on top.<br /><br />I know other tents have strong chemical scent but this one doesn't. As I said earlier, I bought it directly from their website and specifically because it is USA made. Maybe I'm little paranoid, but I'm not interested for my son to be a test subject for Chinese toy manufacturers.\n",
      "I have always used this particular type of feeder for my Hummers. My only complaint is that the bases do not last as long as the bottle and Perky Pet charges almost as much (if you include the shipping charge) as it costs for a whole new feeder. Therefore I am forced to either throw away perfectly good feeder bottles that could still be used or spend as much on the replacement base as I would on a new feeder. I have three bases right now sitting unused under my kitchen sink that could be outside but for the fact that I can not being myself to pay for the replacement base.\n",
      "Got this one to replace my older fluorescent tube light which used to consume more power,not environment friendly and used to heat up.This tubelight gives more luminosity than other types of tubelights and also consumes very less power.Also an eco-friendly option to use.Never heats up and also has an 2 year warranty.Wins on every aspect as compared with other technologies of tube lights.\n",
      "Wonderful item, my mother just recently got me a puppy and I was thrilled but also overwhelmed with having to train him. My mom gave me this to borrow to try with Hunter and I did and he stopped barking each time I used it. Of course I only used it when he was barking at times he should not have been barking like at the trash cans being pulled up or at rocks. I love my hunter and I am glad he learned thanks to this whistle.\n",

      "I'm not regular in review writing on Amazon, but this Zuhne sinks quality and unique feature inspired me to share my own experience with you! How far I know, this Zuhne sinks are manufactured in one of the most advanced manufacturing facilities globally using industrial strength 16 gauge T304 stainless steel from Posco, a world leader in quality steel. I really surprised to know this products contain 25% more steel than the industry standard resulting in sinks do not bow, warp or dent under the weight of heavy cookware. Whether you are draining boiling pasta one moment or flushing ice cold water next. Most interesting, I'm satisfied to use this awesome product, just recommending!!\n",
      "This home theater system is just the bomb! I still cant believe I got it at that price. The sound is super awesome and the speakers are solid and sturdy. The speakers can also be hang on the wall and the cables are long enough for that purpose. This is one heck of a system; sounds too nice for the money.\n",
      "I am very pleasantly surprised with this bag! It's defiantly a nice bag and holds the stuff I need it to, it not as dark as you can see it in the picture, but that's the nature of leather. The bag is soft and very well put together. This bag was also better than expected on quality. Pleased with the quality and feel for the product especially for the cost. I am really happy with it and would highly recommend this bag!\n",
      "You can't beat the sound and smell of a Zippo. The sound of the lid flipping metallically open and then the strike and the fumes of lighter fluid catching on fire - it is unbeatable. Throw away your ugly Bics and make the world a prettier place.\n",

      "I had some reservations about using a shock collar, but after talking to an experienced trainer, he recommended one. I learned about why the technology is useful and that it's not damaging to the dog. It's like when you shock yourself after walking across the carpet. I took several descriptions to my trainer and we decide on Hot Spot. It's been very helpful. We were able to adjust the level of static shock and vibration as we went along, which was really helpful.\n",
      "It's always been my companion at work. I love this 3 in one Kopiko because I can make instant coffee while at work, even if i'm really busy. The taste is strong but sweet and I really like it.. the smell and all.. it's perfect..\n",

      "This travel scale works well.  No more guessing the weight of our suitcases.  We checked the accuracy and it passed.  The scale is sturdy. If you use it as intended, it should last a long time.  You can lift the suitcase and press the hold button so you can look at how much it weighed after you put it down.<br /><br />This scale should last us a long time. It takes a coin cell battery that is easy to replace.  Comes in a box, not a plastic bag.\n",

      "I  was tired of having my cat wake me up earlier and earlier every morning for food. After reading tons of reviews I decided to bite the bullet and buy this unit even though it is much more expensive then ones you will find at chain pet stores. I've been (or should I say my cat has been) using this feeder now for over a year and it continues to perform reliably as expected. It can be tricky to get the adjustment right for the amount of food (you will have to spend some time adjusting..testing...adjusting) but once you get it set it works pretty well!!!\n",
      "Have used this a couple of times. I bought this in Yonex stall and this model is good for a beginner like me. Very light weight and string tension is just perfect for my power smash.. :D\n",

      "I live in an area with low quality local water and figured it's time to get a decent drinking water filter system for my family.<br />I browsered for waster filter systems on line for a bit and decided to try this one because it's made in the USA and it comes from direct seller.<br />I installed it myself, you can do it too. The filter system is made with great materials and the water coming out of it is clear and clean.\n",

      "I have lots of problems with eczema. I have learned that not many skin moisturizers and lotions tend to work on my excessively dry and flaking skin.  I have used Aveeno in the past, but I would really like to  use something a little less expensive than what I've been using. So I tried this coconut oil out to see if it was just going to gloss over and dry out like petroleum jelly and olive oil does. To my amazement, my skin absorbed it and stayed moisturized a lot longer than Aveeno does on my skin.  I use it after every shower and put on a fresh application right before I go outside. I like the idea of using something that costs less. I sold on this oil and will be using it as long as it is available.\n",

      "I purchased the Infinitec Pocket TV with the Air remote included and I am very happy with my purchase so far. I have been using it to stream films online, use news and social networking apps, play some casual games on the big screen, and have had no problems. None of the stuttering and so on that has been reported for some of the android TV dongles out there. The WiFi works reasonably well and the Air Remote is very user friendly and pairs up well with the dongle.<br /><br />These guys have great customer support (I received a personalized thank you letter from their VP of sales), and ship almost immediately. I first read about Infinitec on Kickstarter, and I picked this dongle over others because it has a recognizable name. People are very active on the Infinitec tech support forum which helps deal with minor issues that one might encounter and how to do cool things with the device.\n",
      "This is the camera for the high-speed adventurer always taking things to the next level! It can capture all of your travels from your point of view! It’s waterproof and shockproof so it can withstand a whole lot. All professional quality, all good. Can’t wait to take this sky diving!\n",

I hope that it will helps everybody in my family who have need it. And this Universal Remote Control of price is so much reasonable as a result anybody will purchase it easily. So you will try this.\n",
      "It is light, well built, and although the plastic seems like it might be slightly more fragile than the Apple equivalents, it is more than sturdy enough and feels quite solid. The screw downs are all recessed (a nice touch) and the connections are all gold plated (at least they look gold plated). The cable length is just right, and the connector itself fits perfectly. The cable itself is heavily molded and doesn't seem as fragile as other similar dongles, so it should stand up to years of abuse. The device is relatively small but obviously the box end is larger than a single DVI or VGA adapter, and measures about twice the length of an Apple DVI dongle and about 70-80% the length of most of my 3rd party dongles. On the other hand, it is thinner than my other dongles which helps in the bag. Considering you'd need three separate adapters, you could be reducing your carry weight by over 4-fold.\n",

      "this is definitely one of the best games out there, i had bought this for my son and he enjoys it, even I wanna play it sometimes, he owns all the Super Mario games and i think i made the best decision when i bought it. the quality of the graphics is good, we can't complain because you have to be reasonable that the system is from years ago and is still one of the classics so for me it is good.<br /><br />no matter the amount of cables is has around i like it very much and the controllers are simple but not ugly or uncomfortable. i think the mario games are the best because he just doesn't stop playing them.<br /><br />if you have never experienced this console you haven't lived yet. i highly recommend it.\n",
      "I live in a metro area with a clear line of sight to my window but still had issues getting tv signals with rabbit ear antennas. The paper thin antenna worked!

      "Got this for my son who got a 50&#34; tv during the black  Friday sale at Christmas.  Went up easily, tv fits great and no issues with it at all.  Well pleased with VideoSecu.  I tend to stick with their tv mounts because I've had the best luck with them.  Recommended!\n",
      "Great product, I got one of these to cut down on how much I pack on hiking trips/camping trips and it has really helped. Not only does it take less space but this thing is so light when you're carrying yet still has a solid swing-through when you hit something. My favorite part about this is that the serrated edge is actually sharp unlike those cheap tools made in China.\n",

      "I am a somewhat overweight male. I got this because not only was gravity keeping me from sit-ups, i also found them to be uncomfortable to my lower-back/ tailbone. This pad has made them much more comfortable for me! ... side-note, my 2 year old loves to wrap himself up in it for fun, and it makes a really good ramp for match box cars.\n",
      "Fantastic. Easy to use. Clear instructions. Nice selection of chimes. Works really well. I've used other makes in the past and this one is nice and clear, the push button is waterproof. Having two receivers allows me to put one near the garden so I can always hear the door bell.\n",

      "My family had spent hundreds of  $$$ on pest control over the course of one year, when we didn't have babies in the house yet it was okay to use chemicals although it still poses health risks to adults.<br /><br />But we usually schedule fumigation and chemical pest control work around trips. However, it doesn't take that long for insects to return so we had to do it regularly.<br />When my niece was born 4 months ago, we decided not to have chemicals sprayed in our home anymore and we switched to only environmental friendly products.<br /><br />This one is a steal for $16, it's safe and non-toxic and it works so well.\n",

      "This review is for Wellness WellBites Soft Natural Dog Treats,...  We discovered these Wellness WellBites about a year ago.  The vet put Freddy on a grain free diet and so many treats contain grains.  We had to find something he liked that he could eat.  We bought a bunch of different treats that were grain free.  But the one Freddy seemed to like the best was these WellBites.  The treats are about 1.25&#34; square.  I cut them in to quarters because Freddy is a toy Poodle and doesn't need a whole treat each time.  To him, the quarter is enough good flavor for him to enjoy.  I also cut them into slivers and we play a game where I hide little pieces around the house and he has to sniff them out and find them.  He loves that game.  These treats have enough scent that he can find them fairly easily.  They cut easily with scissors.  The bag lasts a really long time since we only give 1/4 pieces each time.  It lasts at least a month or 5 weeks.  He does get other treats, but he gets at least 2 whole WellBites, cut into pieces, every day.  This is an excellent treat that my dog truly loves.  It's the only treat he has never grown tired of.\n",
      "This product is a quality kit with reasonable price, really easy to use and perfect size for full frame DSLR. I watched a few videos and figured out how to do it myself, and this product did a great job of cleaning my sensor. I had to use two of them to get a good spotless result, but that was expected! Plenty left for next use!\n",

Absolutely love them.  Would definately recommend anyone that does not have them to give them a try.\n",
      "This collar finally ended all of my frustrations with my 3 yr old schnauzer. Before purchasing the collar, my dog would bark uncontrollably at any person or dog she saw whenever I had her outside. After the first day, the barking got greatly reduced, this collar has helped out so much.\n",

      "I've been using flea and tick spray on my cat for years now since she's extremely sensitive to flea medication. She would foam from the mouth and have mild seizures from time to time. I just couldn't take the chances anymore and was forced to find an alternative.<br /><br />There's a lot of flea and tick sprays and was originally using one that has tea tree, but was told that it's bad for cats because of liver function. So I started looking for something more cat friendly.<br /><br />I've been using using this product for several months and just recently saw that they sell it a lot cheaper on amazon. It does kill insects on contact, but doesn't last more than a day. I would spray her daily before she comes or goes outside to not track anything in. It's more of an immediate insect repellent.\n",
      "While you are searching a cheaper priced ink, this one is perfect. Installation is very easy and the machine correctly reads the colour levels. Much recommended for the cheaper priced cartridges.\n",
      "The quality of this underwear is really good. It is like those leading brands in the market. It fits well and it does not snug or anything like that. I washed it first and it did not shrink. I will recommend this to all. I received this for free for my honest feedback\n",

      "I have had many bluetooth speakers. My husband goes through several a year because he uses them so frequently. So, when we were offered the opportunity to try this Bluetooth Speaker with LCD Display I was excited - but I was not sure that it would be any different from the others we have used.<br /><br />I took the speaker out of the box immediately after receiving it - and I have to say that I was very impressed with its overall look. It's very modern, sleek and sophisticated looking. Plus, the weird waterproof velvety texture is fun and feels nice. I love the bright blue LCD screen - it makes it super easy to see what channel you are on - or which controls you are using.<br /><br />I also loved that unlike so many other devices of this variety - this bluetooth speaker has it's own charger - it does NOT run off of batteries! It has a USB style charger that plugs into the wall or your computer. It charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time. No more having to buy batteries every week. You will get back the cost of this speaker just in the lack of having to buy batteries.<br /><br />The speaker is really simple to use - my phone found it easily - and, after the first time - they are now friends! My phone and the speaker find each other instantly - no lag time. The sound quality is amazing. This is probably one of the larger waterproof shower style speakers that I have owned - and it definitely has a lot of oomph to it. The speaker itself has its own volume and also responds to the media level on your phone. That can take a little getting used to - but it's pretty simple. Overall, I am in love with this speaker. We use it every day - it suctions to a wide variety of surfaces 0 si we can use it all around the house. I really wish it came in more bright, fun colors - but other than that I am super satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely buy this again.\n",
      "This product really works. I have two maltese and they had the pink around their eyes, mouth and paws. This is my second order and they are sooooo white now this really works. I highly recommend this product Canine Clear tear stain remover for dogs from one happy dog owener.\n",

      "Received this on-time as promised from seller. This little RC is a blast. So far have only flown it indoors, still trying to grasp the subtle control requirements. This is my first RC and I know I'll have to practice (a lot) to be able to control this thing. Still I am having a blast with it. If you have a modicum of patience and get a kick out of technology, I highly recommend this toy. This is not a professional drone, don't expect it to perform like one. If you want a drone, pay the extra thousand bucks (or more) and buy one.\n",
      "I love this they are so easy to use!! I run a daycare out of my house. I was so worried about on of the little one hitting the edge of the coffee table, so I took them out of the living room.

      "When I came across kinesiology tapes, I felt right away that they might just do the trick.  I wanted to see if they would support my muscles & tendons and also what it would do for my ache & pain areas, especially my lower leg muscles.  I stay very active, but as I am quickly moving into my middle age, my body does not recuperate as quickly as in my younger years.<br /><br />Fortunately for me and my clients, as an experienced personal health/fitness trainer/consultant (path2fit.com), I looked methodically into kinesiology or kinesio tapes to see if it actually worked or was just hype. And as anyone who knows me can tell you, I test something very carefully before recommending it.<br /><br />I compared Kinesiology TAPE + to a few other top brands that are on the market.  My methodology was to put Kinesiology TAPE + on one calf (where I was experiencing over tightness and spasms after workouts) and a competing brand on the other. I then switched the competing brand to another brand after a few days.  What I found is that Kinesiology TAPE + is as stretchy, super-sticky, water/grease proof as it claims.  I actually put it on right after one of my work outs when I was sweaty & oily, as most of us are after a good work out session.  I was surprised that it not only stayed on but it even lasted at least a week through workouts and showers.<br /><br />Instantly, when applied, I did not even feel my injured areas.  That allowed me to continue my exercise routine when I was sure I would have to rest or alter the routine drastically for a few days till I improved.  When it naturally came off, which was a lot longer than I anticipated, it had helped to heal the sensitive area with no allergic reaction on my skin whatsoever.<br /><br />The other brands, even though they had a somewhat similar effect, did not feel as good or last as long as the Kinesiology TAPE +.  And some left sticky, hard-to-remove glue trace after they came off.  Kinesiology TAPE + did not.<br /><br />I do recommend to follow the instructions of cutting the edges in a slightly rounded shape so it will stay on longer.<br /><br />Another thing that I like about Kinesiology TAPE + is that we don't have to be medical professionals to be able to apply & use the Kinesiology TAPE +.  Instructions come in YouTube videos that assist us in applying the Kinesiology TAPE + to the areas in our body that need extra TLC.<br /><br />The almost magical Kinesiology TAPE + has helped me not only keep my exercise routine going but has aided me in healing the inflamed & sore areas in my body including my lower leg muscles.\n",

      "These wall decals are true to the the picture. They were very easy to apply and although each piece is separate, they are numbered so it allows you to put your own twist on it. I would recommend them for anyone who is looking to add a little forest to the room. We used in the nursery and it matches perfectly with the enchanted forest theme that we picked. We finished the whole wall in about an hour.\n",
      "I am so happy with the opportunity to evaluate these  in ear earbuds  from Symphonized they are the best once you try these from this company you will not use any other earbuds.

      "Can't tell a difference between this and the original tubes it flows beautifully , highly recommended as so much cheaper<br />And is exactly the same thing\n",
      "Really pleased with this product. I thought I would be changing the batteries all the time, but they seem to last for days. I like the remote control feature, much easier than switching them all on by hand. I am considering buying more of these candles for Christmas presents. I think other people will appreciate them too.\n",
      "Really good , changes into fantastic colours and look great in hurricane jars . Made my life so much easier just by the press of a button , will be looking for more in the future\n",
      "I love this thing. I have an older car, and have used this several times to pinpoint and fix the inevitable problems myself, rather than sacrifice money to the auto shop gods. This will also give you some idea what the error codes actually mean, and allows you to clear them. Navigation is also really easy, which isn't always the case with some units that attempt to get by with less than half the buttons of this thing.<br /><br />I've only dipped my toes into the more advanced functions. Honestly there's more capability available than I could really competently use. But it's been nice to have available.\n",

My wife is disabled and therefore does not want to open the front door without first knowing who is there.<br /><br />The amount of crime reported on the media, she is able to decline to open the front door to cold callers and anyone else she does not know.<br /><br />This Video entry system works very well and easy to install and use.

      "I've been using this product with my iPad for over a week. The two connect together very well as soon as the speakers are turned on. The size is perfect to carry around with the iPad. Sound quality is excellent and the bass not too shabby for such a compact unit. Most impressive is the battery life, I must have had over 12 hours use so far on the same set of rechargeable AA cells. I'm pleased with this product.\n",
      "I love these earrings! They are small and petite, and perfect for dressing up or down. I have worn them alone with jeans, and also in my second holes with another pair of earrings for an evening out. The 14K white gold is what I shop for as my ears are very sensitive to different metals. I have had absolutely no problems with these. The diamonds do not have the luster of the higher end clarity, but they still sparkle in the light, and I am completely happy with my investment.\n",

      "I really like the heavy glass base. I see no possibility of the set tipping over.  There are 3 HDMI ports and one is especially wired for Roku so that you can easily switch from TV to Roku.    I hooked up her Roku LT Streaming Media Player via an HDMI port and quickly set it up. You can get both cheap on amazon here:  [...]  [...]    I did need to change the 'Source' on the included remote to HDMI in order to view the input from the Roku. *No HDMI cables come with the TV, but the High-Speed HDMI Cable linked above Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return work well and are very inexpensive.    Being a 720P LED TV with 60Hz refresh rate, my expectations for the picture were not as high as one with a 1080P resolution. I was pleasantly surprised when I turned it on how sharp the over-the-air picture was using a Mohu Leaf 50 Amplified Indoor Antenna to pick up over air broadcast TV. I picked mine up at the store but amazon again has a good price  [...]    I hooked up the HDTV antenna to the 'Ant In' port on the back of the TV and then ran a 'Air' based channel scan to pick up my local over air broadcast channels. Then saved the channels into the TV's memory. It was super quick and easy to do, and the uncompressed HD channels which are broadcast free over the air are even sharper than cable or satellite channels which use compressed signals. (If you want to know more about how to get over-the-air free TV, check out my book: Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV and if you want to learn how to supplement over air TV with internet TV from Sling TV, check out Simple Guide to Sling TV. )    No, it's not a smart TV with apps, so if you use streaming media and want to view Netflix, you'll need to attach a device to the TV as I did with the Roku box. It doesn't have 1080P resolution, but at only 32\", you really won't be able to tell with most high definition programming.    The term 'Roku Ready' is simply a gimmick in my opinion, and considering TCL is one of only two brands putting out the Roku TV, it makes sense they'd be trying to make this non-Roku TV appear just as appealing.    This TV is well made and provides a very nice picture. The included remote is easy to navigate and works well. The HDTV has connectivity ports that allow it to be used as a PC monitor or as a TV (a digital tuner is inside).    All in all I recommend YOU get the:  [...]    I hope this review was helpful!

      "I really like the instructor and found the DVD interesting and easy to follow.

The ingredients does not start with corn meal or other carbs. It's very simple: your cat is a carnivore and should be eating meat not corn. When I switched my cat from another brand to Iams, he lost two pounds and now looks sleek and healthy.\n",

      "I ordered this rug pad to go under a rug we just got from here. It is really excellent quality, being made of felt-type fibers with a rubberized layer on one side. It is the best rug pad I have seen. It adds a firm noticeable lift to the rug yet gives a nice cushiony feel and I am sure will lengthen the life of the rug.\n",
      "I love that this grill has compartment/side tables where I can place whatever it is I'm grilling before actually grilling it. I use the one on the side for my condiments and marinade that I brush my steak with from time to time while grilling. . best feature for me though is the upper part great for heating pita wraps, schubligs, and everything that only needs quick heating or smoking.\n",
      "Good price and good quality. However  the handles have a small \"V\" at the bottom to keep them from rotating. I like the full range of motion and notice regular push up are much easier. great tool if you have to do push ups for your job like me .I like it .\n",
      "This product is awesome, I am going to use it when ever in need of an emergency power, but the look is just great. There is a lot of power and works great because I tested it out and I am really satisfied with this product.\n",

      "This is a great genuine sandalwood mala for meditation. The quality of the beads is much better than what I have seen or used before. Nice light sandalwood smell at least for the first few days. The strap is not thread, but a thin elastic material which seems to be holding rather well. Took a while to reach here but well worth the wait.\n",
      "Needed a new bell, shopped around, read all the reviews and decided on this one.<br /><br />What do you need a bell for - obviously to tell you someone is at the door. Its portable base/ringer unit works well all over the house (if I take it with me) and in the garden so I can sit outside and enjoy the weather and still know if someone is at the door. Choice of ringers is not the widest on the market but lets face it I dont need a smash hit to play to tell me I need to answer my door I just need to know!\n",
      "I must say I just god this, and is very comfortable, The mattress set seems very durable and was a great price,  is just what I needed to get that comfortable sleep , It was hard to decide what mattress we wanted, but after we choose this one, It got shipped after 3 days , so I'm​ pretty happy.I fully recomand this\n",

      "Its an amazing product, there was a time our dog was extremely noisy and it came to the point where we can't stand it anymore. I decided to buy a bark control dog collar and luckily, I found this one. It is very effective and soon our dog was trained when and when not to bark.\n",
      "This no bark collar works great! I used it on my puppy, who had to learn not to bark at inappropriate times, and she just needed to have it go off once and the barking issue was gone. Perfect!<br /><br />I like that it gives warnings, and that the shock starts off very low and gets increasingly greater, giving the dog the chance to get the concept without giving them more than they can handle.<br /><br />Would recommend this!\n",

We ended up having cracks in the roofing the racoons exploited, but before we could afford to fix it we applied the repellent to the area. We immediately had less of an issue than we had been in the past couple weeks, and I have to attribute it to the repellent. This is a strong product.\n",

      "I have a fairly high-end home theater system. Unfortunately my living room has hardwood flooring and therefore it is fairly difficult to install speaker wires without creating a fair amount of clutter. I looked at a few wireless speaker kits. I definitely want good quality and thus didn't opt for an entry-level model. However, I didn't want to fork out $500 for such a kit either and thus opted for the Amphony kit which is slightly less than $200.<br /><br />At that price point I was somewhat concerned that the build quality of the kit would not meet my expectations. After receiving and unpacking the kit, I was pleasantly surprised though. While both the transmitter and wireless amplifier units are packaged in a plastic enclosure, they are by no means cheaply built. They have a comfortable feel to them. The two wireless amplifiers are extremely light and quite small. I don't mind that since I have just enough space under my rear speakers to slide them in. I like the fact that unlike other wireless kits you get 2 wireless amps. The only drawback is that you have to set the volume on each amp before using the kit. If you have a fairly modern home theater receiver like I do, however, you just have to set the volume to approximately what you need and let the auto calibration routine of the home theater receiver do the fine tuning. So overall the installation is pretty straightforward.<br /><br />The sound itself is crystal clear - no hissing or crackling whatsoever. I figure that this kit would also be ideal to put some speakers in other rooms of my house but I haven't done any extensive range testing. For what it is worth this kit works extremely well in my living room. Oh, did I mention that even though I have a fair amount of other wireless gear in the house, I haven't had any issues with interference. I guess this is because this kit works at a different frequency. I really like this kit.\n",

      "Being that I work a tremendous amount of hours each week from home it's nice to know that I have one less thing to worry about (getting carpal tunnel) because this edge and corner guard set help with the positioning of my wrists and hands.

      "I love this key ring it is leather made of very high quality, durable will last for a really long time. It has two rings then you get two bonus ones for a total of four they hook on with the push of a button and can be taken off just as easily.

I would highly recommend these gloves to anyone. I know they will be useful during the holidays when preparing baked and deep fried turkeys! You will not be disappointed!\n",
      "The waterproof pouch works great. It's adjustable and fits around the waist. We go to the beach and sometimes I worry a bit (depending on the beach) about leaving my phone, hotel card, id etc on the beach while I wander off looking for shells or take a swim in the water, but I don't want to leave them locked in the car or in the hotel room either. This is the perfect way to keep my little stuff with me while not worrying about it getting wet or sandy, and makes me beach experience even more relaxing and enjoyable.\n",
      "I haven't bought non name brand staples, because the price difference is negligible. These fit just fine into the swingline staplers we have, and staple pages with no issues. They're staples. I don't know what else to say.\n",
      "When I first purchased these headphones I never realized how versatile they would be. Most Bluetooth headsets I own are much smaller and go inside the ears. They aren't as comfortable as these are.  The padding is great for long listening. You won't ever get that uncomfortable or sweaty ears situation.<br />I also appreciate the fact that each time I have gone well over 10 hours without having to recharge them which is a feature that is nice. Lastly I know have been able to use them at night when I am unable to sleep. I can listen to anything on my iPad or MacBook without having to wake my wife up.\n",

      "When it comes to traveling, my family and I love to take off often just to see the world out there. But the stress of packing is one thing I hate about these trips. We don't seem to be able to gather our stuff together in order. Sometimes, we just can't find where we placed our passports or other convenient items when we need. It is usually a distressing thing for me to keep searching for an item, unloading and reloading entire luggage only to discover that what we are looking for is hidden somewhere inside one if the bags.<br />But recently a friend told us about these packing cubes. We ordered it and used many of the 4 set pcs during our last trip. It was fun! The relief was unimaginable. We had all our stuff packed in different cubes in such a way that we can easily identify and retrieve them. Even at the airport, the guys did not have to keep running their fingers through our bags as everything was relatively easy for them to check. The trip was a breeze! My kids loved these packing cubes so much. Each three of them had their own packing cubes with their items kept separately.<br />My wife love to pack her make-up in the smallest size, her other intimate items in the smaller ones and then arrange her stuff in order using the remaining ones. The different sizes make packing different items easy. On returning from our trips, we find these packing cubes even more useful. We are able to separate dirty clothes from the clean ones and thus avoid all the disappointments that come with opening your bags in the public.<br />These packing cubes truly make traveling very convenient. It is worth every penny you can spend on it. You cannot put a price on convenience! I will buy more of it and give out to friends. The fact is that many people are not really aware of this type of product and what it can do for them. In a very mobile world, organization is essential. This is where these packing cubes come to play. You can never go wrong with these packing cubes and all theconvenience that come with.\n",
      "Love it, about 600 pages so far and not one hick up. It installed with out any issues. I would definitely buy again.\n",
      "Five Stars<br /><br />I bought this headset weeks ago, it was beyond what I expected for the price I paid and though I do not use them anymore as I am upgrading to one of creatives more premium offerings they still work perfectly no issues with them at all not in four years of use will do fine for games and music as long as you remember the price tag when judging the sound it hits above its weight.\n",

Also, I have tried using my corded headphones, and I always end up snagging the cord and having to remove the jack to change the music.  So I got this pair of headphones and the sound quality is better than the corded version.  The straps on top of the head really lock the phones on there, and the cushioned ear-pieces hold environmental noise at bay.  Very good product that I recommend buying!\n",

      "I can't stand any kind of pests but rats and mice are some of the worst. I started using this after using traps alone and annual pest patrol services weren't containing the problem enough. They still manage to get in my garrage in particular and my sons car parked outside would have problems related to mice trifiling through the mechanics. However now I've been spraying this accross my garrage entrance and door which seems to be dettering them quite well, and as this seems to be the main entrance point for them to the house I havent come accross another inside as of yet. My sons also pleased, the mice seem to be staying away from his car now. Nice and easy to use just a spray every few weeks, not bad.\n",

      "Our 8 month old twins love this toy - and I'm sure it will continue to be a hit as they grow. At this age, they love pulling out the objects from inside the box. Once they get bored of them, I'm sure I can add other toys and household items to the box to keep things interesting. As they grow, we'll likely use the box by playing &#34;guess what's inside&#34; and encourage language development and memory skills. This is a great toy for all ages.\n",
      "These bags are perfect.  They are just the right size and plenty strong enough.  They've got an adorable little carry case.  I like the fact that they give you a lot of bags so you don't have to buy too often.  A must for pet owners.    I wanted to add one more thing:  These are perfect size also to put a dirty diaper in. We had a yucky one and no trash close by so we put it in the bag and able to dispose of later with no mess!\n",

My little sister craves for one and she is thinking of buying one too! The only dislike I have is that the cleaning instructions are in Japanese and I was unsure as to how to proceed in washing it. I put it in my washing machine in warm water and let it dry on a hanger just to be on the safe side and the fabric was as soft as when it first arrived. What a relief! But all in all, I love it!\n",
      "A one of a kind, indie masterpiece. A dark and hypnotic drama that simultaneously explores the ecstasy of new found love and the wrenching pain of loss. Transatlantic teeters on the edge of a fever dream, but never falls off giving it a thrilling undercurrent, even when its pacing is deliberate and almost meditative. All of this while exhibiting an eroticism and honesty about sex that is all but nonexistent in mainstream American cinema. And I would be remiss if I didn't point out the beautiful and hardened lines of New York City serve as the perfect backdrop to the story. Transatlantic Coffee is another reminder that independent film is alive and well and worth finding.Loved every minute, with it's deep script and breathtaking visuals. Can't believe it's FREE on Prime! Rent it, if you like real filmmaking. Don't rent if you want explosions.\n",
      "Works great!I've been using media player for a number of years and this little Crenova1080P media player just came to my attention the past few weeks because I was looking for a new one to buy for my new apartment.

This little player provides a full spectrum of support almost all video formats in the market place today and up to 1080P HD level. It is extremely easy to setup (it is basically plug and play !). Quality of the play back video is excellent. With this low price, one cannot resist to having this little play in your pocket. Unless one is looking at additional features such as internet access.

      "Meade is an amazing instructor. I recommend buying this DVD if you are a massage therapy instructor, a beginning student or an experienced therapist who would like to feel confident performing prenatal massage. Meade's approach to pregnancy massage is very gentle and he shows how to position the mother to be in many positions so she will be comfortable during the massage. He shows different massage tables and bolster techniques for prenatal massage and includes detailed massage sequences. The discussion about posture is very informative as well. Lots of useful information that can be only of great use to the future parents. I recommend this DVD. Very beneficial.\n",

      "I have had this little pedaller for over a year now and wanted to make a second review.  If you haven't already looked at this you should: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWK09Q?tag=i60-20  I originally got this for my mom because she has some heart issues, after years of high blood pressure and diabetes. It will go only as fast as you pedal so she likes how she can take it slow while watching tv, to improve circulation in her legs.  However, if you are a young healthy person looking for a cardio workout in confined space / on the cheap, this is also very effective. Although of course not as effective at burning calories as running outside, if this is what you have to work with, it's doable.  As a note, if you are using this for serious cardio (30+ minutes), I highly suggest buying some ankle weights (3-5 lbs per leg) and wearing them while you pedal - it makes it around twice as hard and is very effective. I bought some weights on amazon with the free shipping option for less than ten dollars.\n",

I have a VPN with private access network and their android app works with the Box, no issues at all. Highly Recommended.\n",

      "You can drop a grand on expensive wrought iron or wicker furniture OR you can get something more comfortable and more versatile for a fraction of the cost!<br /><br />You should totally check this out:<br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B0032UY0BU/<br /><br />Using this chair, you can sit up straight, recline partially (which i usually do), or recline to a sleeping position and I find each of these positions to be very comfortable. It does not, however, allow you to lay out flat, such as if you wanted lay on your stomach. You will need a true lawn chair for that. This chair is similar in operation to a recliner but it reclines further and puts your feet higher than most recliners do.<br /><br />Most of you are probably wondering about the length and size of the chair, so I will do my best to give you an idea. I am 6'1&#34;&#34; and 200 lbs. When I lay on the chair with my legs extended, the bottom bar rests under my achilles. However, I rarely sit like that - I usually use the bar as a foot rest and is one of my favorite features. If i do straighten my legs with my achilles on the bar it is not uncomfortable. Without the pillow, the top of my head would rest on the top bar. But since the pillow can be moved up pretty high, I would say it could accommodate someone even a little taller than me. I would not get the wide version because it would be unnecessarily more expensive and would put the armrests farther out. My father-in-law is 5'11&#34;&#34; 270 lbs and is also comfortable in this chair.<br /><br />These chairs fold up tightly and store easily in our garage when not in use. If you grab the right part (turn them sideways and grab the middle bar) it carries easily with one hand.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the grips slipping when the chair partially reclined. I have noticed this too, but only if I'm moving around, like if I lean forward to reach for something. When I'm leaned back into the chair, the chair is centrally balanced and doesn't slipfor me. If I notice that the grips have moved, I just readjust and re-tighten. The grips are right by your hands so this isn't hard to do. Overall, this hasn't been an irritation for me.<br /><br />I am glad I read other peoples comments about rust. Mine are usually under our covered patio, but I would not allow these sit out in the rain uncovered. The outside metal is water treated, but the inside is not, so the inside could collect water, rust, and potentially spill onto your clothes or something else.<br /><br />Have owned them for two years and still love em.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful. If you found this review helpful, please mark yes below.\n",

      "When I was a little child I used to watch the Donald cartoons every Sunday afternoon. We lived in these years in Poland so it was so difficult to found Donald tales. After we moved to USA and my brother and perhaps also myself watch this cartoon regularly. My favourite character was Dagobert. He was so funny.<br /><br />Some months ago I started to watching Donald films again. It is a great fun! I still enjoy these stories. My childrens (2 boys and 1 girl) also like it.<br /><br />Donald duck for ever!\n",
      "An excellent portable Bluetooth speaker. Connected immediately to my iPad, iPhone and my husband‘s Samsung Galaxy phone. It comes complete with a USB  connection (to enable you to charge the speaker) .On taking the speaker out of its own box I swiched it on and within seconds a VERY LOUD voice told me that it was Pairing and then the same loud voice told me it was connected. I am amazed at the ease of using this speaker. During the day (the battery lasted all day without my charging it) I had a few calls on my phone. I was able to answer the calls through the speaker. It cuts out the music whilst answering the calls. Also buttons to go forwards and backwards through the songs and also buttons to allow you to adjust the sound. I was able to take the speaker around the whole house with me during the day. The battery lasted 10 hours. I was amazed. It now automatically connects when I switch it on due to the NFC function but I admit when pairing for the first time you need to have the item close to speaker to enable it to pair so easily. We highly recommend this speaker not only because of the ease of using it but for value for money. Any other speaker of the same calibre would cost a lot more. Do not hesitate, it is super.\n",
      "I didn't think this hose would meet my needs when I first bought it, because it was so lightweight. I thought to myself “how can something so lightweight be durable enough to last”. Well, come to find out, my train of thought was completely wrong, this hose is super durable and has never given me any problems, it works just like it did the day I bought it. It doesn't kink, stores well, and is easy to use. This hose is perfect for my needs!!\n",

      "Walking my pit bull has never been an easy work. Every leash I have ever purchased has either broken or I was not able to control my dog with them. I was ecstatic when I came across the hands free dog leash from Quality Choices and knew I had to give it a try at such a great price. I have dropped and broken my phone from my dog dragging me while walking. Starr was confused and stayed by my side when I wrapped the belt around me and we took off for a fast walk. After a few minutes she was back in front, big ears flopping in the wind. With this hand free leash I have more control using my body and now it feels like my dog and I are having a real connection while walking. If that is not enough for anyone the free LED light that connects to the leash for night walking is enough to purchase. Dogs like mine that are scared of the dark and taking her outside at night is a huge trouble. The LED light helps my dog with better vision at night time!\n",

      "My son found his goggles uncomfortable and they would annoy him and one of the other mums mentioned this product and how it was much easier.

      "Just received my watch case. It came double boxed and was really well packaged. The inner box had foam on top of the glass and the whole thing was also covered in a plastic wrap. Much better than what you usually see.<br /><br />Since the case was relatively cheap, I expected the usual low quality manufacturing. I was pleasantly surprised. The glass top is really glass, and the whole thing looks quite attractive. The top opens easily, the inserts are nice and sturdy.<br /><br />I was even happier when I saw that my larger Casio watches had room in the compartments. Usually they are too tight to fit well. I managed to fit my whole Casio collection in this case. The solar models are in the center so that they can still catch some light while protected in the box.<br /><br />I highly recommend this case, probably the best one in this price range. I would buy another if I needed more room for watches.\n",

It is very easy to brew and this brand also allows you the ability to get several brews or steepings out of each of the leaves.

      "Fits perfectly with my http://www.amzn.gift/dp/B006Z2BZBU/  I was unsure about buying these because we've tried other brands of crib sheets that do not fit DD's mattress, even though its a standard size. I decided to try them because the price was low enough to where I wouldn't be upset if they ended up not fitting after all. Luckily these do fit perfectly even after washing and drying several times. We had some thicker flannel ones but I wanted to get some lighter cotton ones for the warmer months and to take to daycare for DD's cot, and these are perfect. They are very soft and lightweight. I purchased the mint and the pink geometic dots. I will definitely be purchasing more in the near future!  ---------  After using these sheets for several months now I've decided to come back and review again.  These sheets are great! I change my daughter's sheets two or three times a week on average, and I only have 5 sheets that fit her bed, so they get washed A LOT. In all those washings the colors on these have not faded, there are no holes, and the elastic is still working great.   The same cannot be said of the other brands of sheets we have tried which we have purchased from both Babies R Us and Target. I will definitely be buying more!  I hope this review was helpful!\n",

It takes regular double AA batteries for both the controller and the car. I look forward to racing my car with my son. This will be great for our bonding time. When I was a kid, my cousins and  I would play  cops and robbers with no toys. Nowadays kids can have toys to add to the action. This particular car comes with lights and sound to add to the fun time. I know this brand makes other types of cars. I will have to see what they have that will be fitting for \"robbers” car.\n",
      "My hubby and I like drinking coffee...a lot!  However, neither of us like a particularly strong cup of coffee.  This particular coffee bean is a nice brown colour and not too oily - much like the coffee beans that you see being used for coffee making in Italy.  It does make quite a strong espresso and, if you like it strong, this will be perfect for you.  We tend to prefer our espresso to be more of a medium roast, so we ended up using these coffee beans to make espresso to use as a base for lattes.  For us, this was perfect!<br />To be fair, it is all down to taste - some people like their coffee stronger than others.  If you like a good quality strong espresso, then this is for you.  Although, if you like your coffee a little milder (cappucinos and lattes), then this also does the job nicely.<br />We will definitely be back for more!\n",

Since their stretchy, I would extend those around half percent for cozy wrap for them not to slip, including top the adhesiveness ensures.

Never attempted these as proposed, nor I would need to in light of the fact that it would expect my harm, not something everyone would like. I would post a few pictures for cutting estimations.

      "I was inspired to go out and buy this bar by research released by Harvard this past march about the health benefits of flavanoids in cocoa. I just went out and picked up the bar with the highest cocoa content assuming I'd be getting a the highest dose of flavanols (the class of flavanoid that is found in cocoa)... after a little more research though, I realized I'd picked the wrong brand for that. Looking at the ingredients, you'll see that the cocoa is &#34;processed with alkali&#34; (aka Dutch processed chocolate). Apparently, 60-90% of flavanoids are removed during Dutch processing (according to wikipedia). From what I read, you're much better off trying trying to find &#34;natural&#34; chocolate if you are going for the health benefits.  On the other hand... I'm totally addicted to this chocolate! At first I found it too bitter and ate it along with some grapes to help sweeten it up, but after a few nights my palate has changed and am loving it just the way it is. Too bad about the Dutch processing.  If you are going for the healthiest brand regardless of price, it looks like the Xocai brand is the way to go. Not only is it natural, but it's cold pressed (heating the chocolate also removes flavinoids) and is sweetened with açai berries. I couldn't find any data on how big of a difference in flavanoid content of cold pressed and non-cold pressed chocolate, but I doubt it's worth the current cost.  There's a few good dark chocolates available here at amazon that are natural and dairy free with high cocoa content including: Dragoba makes an 87% cocoa organic chocolate bar, and Endangered Species makes one at 88% (Black Panther Extreme Dark Chocolate). Stay away from bars that don't post their ingredients on Amazon (such as Green & Black's organic 85% cocoa dark chocolate bar which contains whole milk).  If you love chocolate half as much as me, you should really look into getting   http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00FPGLMLA\n",

I can be playing music upstairs and go downstairs and still hear the music. Plus, it works great with my old third generation iPod. I love the the bass too, usually when I get a speaker there’s not enough bass but this has the perfect sound. And  the weight of it is so light I never have a problem moving it to several places in my house. Another cool thing about the boom box is that the battery reasonably long! I barely have to charge it. Overall, I love this product and would recommend to anyone that loves music.\n",

HBO has done a fantastic job at narrating such a complex story in a rather intricate way yet still keep a great flow to the narration. Kept my attention through the entire Season 1. Can't wait to watch Season 2. This is one of the few books where the movie/TV series has not disappointed those that have read the book.\n",
      "I am starting a small business and need a toner that prints professionally. I don't have a lot of money to work with in this start-up, so I purchase off-brand cartridges. Like most people, I have had several cartridges that - out of the box - they printed with streaks or didn't work at all. To replace them with the company would not be cost effective. So I read reviews carefully. I purchased these toner cartridges because of the life-time guarantee and I noticed the company monitors the feedback on Amazon. The printing is great; however, you can get that with most of the cartridges. What is important to me is if I get a dud, the company will replace it whether I use it now or a year from now. You can't buy that level of service.\n",

      "I got this home gym as a replacement to a different set I purchased here on Amazon just before and I'm so glad I bought it! The other home gym fell apart during use and ended up bending part of the frame after only two weeks. I had hardly gotten to use it before it failed on me, not to mention it has a horrible chemical smell. Overall, I wasn't happy and felt like I completely wasted my money.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting this gym set here on Amazon, you should think again ------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1mxQEYj<br /><br />After dealing with that mess I decided to give the Bowflex a try and I wish I would have from the beginning! Every part of it feels like a quality made machine and I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over a month of having it. It was easy to set up and allows me to do any workout imaginable.<br /><br />I hope I helped point others in the right direction based on my experiences with both sets!\n",

I am going to buy another. Recommend this seller to you.\n",
      "Love these for playing ball with dogs. It's everything we've been looking for, a ball that squeaks with a rope to play tug a war when she brings it back. Rope toys in general are much safer than other toys, especially if you have an aggressive chewer at home. The rope helps you throw the ball further easier and doubles for tug of war her favorite play. Excellent product! Dog loves it!\n",
      "I am using this product for four months now and I can say I am very satisfied with the quality of this product. The installation was straightforward. I had to drill 1/2 hole through my cabinet side to connect the hot water hose. The installation took about 15 minutes. The supplied fittings were handy and the hose was more than enough to connect the cold and hot water. I did not have any leaks after installations. My kids loved the bidet so much that they started using the master bath (I bought one initially to test the bidet). Now I am going to buy 2 more for the other bathrooms.\n",
      "So much for overspending! I am very pleased with my purchase. Reading the reviews I thought it was way to good to be true, but now I see that it is for real. I am impressed with not only the price, but the quality of this battery is great. I did not know that I have been overspending until a friend told me that there are other brand batteries for my collar and I should look into saving some money. I am sure glad I did. I do have high hopes that it will last as long as the others on here but even if it doesn't last just as long I will still be happy with it since I will still be saving a lot of money in the long run. So I will pass on the good news that this is really a good deal and your missing out if you don't take advantage of it.\n",

      "This strolling stick was awesome! Simple to fall and an enormous help as I strolled all over Scotland. I was truly glad to have it! No issue in the airplane terminal at all! AS promoted, these strolling sticks agreeably fit into a knapsack or carry-on, are lightweight, collect effectively, and don't slip once their tallness is situated. They held up well on the stone steps and earth ways of the Amalfi Coast and Capri on a late outing. Whether that keeps on being valid over the whole deal stays to be seen, yet I was totally fulfilled by them. It is elusive strolling sticks that overlap this little (14&#34;) at any value or to discover less collapsible sticks at this cost ($50 for two, with material conveying cases included). I'm exceptionally inspired with these. I have been taking a gander at different collapsible poles now for around 18 months, and constantly figured I'd make good and purchase an arrangement of Black Diamonds.\n",

The price is a winner!!!<br /><br />The other was for a close friend of ours who is alone much of the time.<br /><br />Both were faultless installations as the instructions and quality is excellent. The only problem I encountered was that the distance from where the camera to the video screen on both installs were much further than the cable provided, so I adjusted myself by soldering an extra length.<br /><br />Overall a good buy!

By the time that I realized they were in the machine instead of with my tablet and keys, it was too late to do anything. I resigned myself to buying a new pair and chalked it up to just one more thing that went horribly wrong for me this Mother's Day . But, when I took the clothes out, something said to test them. When I did, they were still working ! And then this morning when I plugged them up at work, still working! So I highly recommend these.

      "When I saw the advertisement for this pillow on television, my curiosity was piqued.  I did some research and found this first, but this was a better deal: http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0045UF6E6/  I have been wanting a new pillow for quite a while as I have been waking up with a sore neck and back in the mornings. I decided to give this one a try.  After the first night, I was not impressed. It seemed awkward and each time I shifted during the night, I had to think about how I was supposed to position my head. I decided that one night was probably not sufficient test time for this pillow. I have slept on it 5 nights now and I really like it. The support for my back is great and just what I was looking for. The way that it wraps around my head makes me feel cozy and supported. I would recommend this pillow for any side sleepers out there looking for a different, more supportive pillow.\n",
      "The acting is without a doubt one of the reasons to see this film. I was surprised to see Fox in a role like this, granted she didn't have too much to do but look and act wounded. She definitely pulls it off and shows that she just may have more range than people give her credit for. Rourke was shockingly mellow in this drama, usually he plays some sort of bad guy, but here he's more of a doormat. The real reason to watch is Murray -- he's not in it as much and he certainly knows how to play a wise-cracking, smart-guy gangster. I, personally, would have loved to see more interactions with Murray and his associates to see how he handled some other situations.\n",

      "Visually inspected the struts. All four struts appears to be well made. Very solid and heavy feel to them. Also, compress the struts by just to see how it feels and they were good. The rear strut were exact fit. However, during the initial test drive there were some initial rattle and clunking sound coming from the trunk. Further inspection showed that the rear upper mount bushing had some wear and was not able to tighten the strut nut all the way - some play left. So, more washers were added so the nut could e tighten all the way and no more play. Push the car up and down to see this. You should see some play if there issue.\n",

      "What a great dog and cat brush. It removes all the loose hair and increases their blood circulation. Cuts down on hair on the furniture.\n",
      "Fantastic movie! Maybe the script was predictable, but I was touched, loved seeing Melissa McCarthy play a serious role, and Naomi Watts was hilarious as a pregnant Russian stripper! And of course, Bill Murray - I was expecting a less complex performance and few surprises, but without giving away the plot, his character had much more depth than I expected. I'll be buying this one.\n",
      "I just tried this for the first time and the first thing I noticed was the vibrant, bright green color of this Matcha. This has been a great addition to my morning routine. I add it to my post workout shake and it goes well with the other ingredients.\n",
      "I received this a few day ago. It does NOT look like the picture shown on the left side of the item on this Amazon web site, which surprised me at a first glance. But later, after I installed it into my Brother printer, it works just fine, though I have just printed 2 test pages.\n",
      "Purchased this for my nieces and they really love it so much. Very happy with my purchased. Thank you.\n",
      "A beautiful bikini set, I love bright colours so this couldn't have been better for me. The perfect size and is very comfortable to wear.\n",
      "As good as advertised if not better. The shirt stays don't come undone no matter what you do. No damage at all to shirts. Really impressed with how these are constructed from all aspects. Very good metal but not too heavy so they are comfy and light. You can tell when you squeeze them how strong they are and that they're going to hold up without breaking. The nylon covers on the insides keep hold of the shirt and don't leave marks. The elastic is soft and doesn't yank on my leg hair. That's a problem I thought I'd always have with shirt stays, but these ones don't do it at all. Big improvement over what I was using before. Even easy to get on despite how hard they grip. Whoever designed these did a really good job. They thought of everything.\n",
      "this product is so tasty. It's delicious and healthy. Also it has a right amount of sugar and calories that's why it's so good. Will buy more.\n",
      "My kid actually likes this. Who would have thought? I remember my kid brother and sister spitting anything green and leafy out. You can grind them up all you like, but they still wouldn't swallow them.\n",
      "This belt works well when combined with diet and exercise. Don't expect this to do all the job. It does burn like hell though!\n",
      "This camera with great picture and video, all the time, it will helps us know when someone is home.<br /><br />The camera works exactly as expected, it has great video quality and it has lot of features: you can view the camera through a web page and even operate it, you can create different accounts with access levels (maybe you want someone to see it but not move the camera), you can set at what time it should start recording with infra-red (or let it figure it out by itself), and you can add many different cameras and monitor all of them from the same interface!<br /><br />I have an android phone, iPad and iPhone in my household. So far all of them worked well. Usually IOS version gets all the developer attention. Android app works really good I was able to do presets, turn on/off motion sensing and configure various things. We are REALLY satisfied.\n",
      "LOOKS GOOD ONCE YOU GET IT FINISHED, I HAVEN'T BUILT A MODEL AIRPLANE IN ALMOST 7 YEARS AND WANTED TO SEE IF I STILL ENJOYED IT. I DON'T! :-) BUT THE AIRPLANE IS NICE.\n",
      "I use this on everything from tacos to enchiladas and its got the perfect taste spice wise and has garlic in there for added flavor. I recommend this to anyone that likes spicy foods - and dont buy it here get it at the local grocery store or walmart.\n",
      "I can shine this  light to help me around in dimly lit rooms. As far as I can see (literally) this light is pretty strong.\n",
      "I got it on sale, but even at the full price this machete is worth it, due to it's high quality construction. The sheath isn't the greatest in the world, but the tool itself is more important. Great buy, recommend!\n",
      "Wonderful device so far I have ever used. We can watch quality movies through this one. I am using since months and still it is running flawlessly. Sophisticated technology and amazing quality. I am completely satisfied.\n",
      "I use this for fitness classes three times a week and it has held up extremely well. The material is comfortable to wear and doesn't cut into the skin. However, note that if worn too tight, it does cause severe itching when removed. It's best to wear this at a comfortable fit, not too tight which I tended to do initially. The material stays dry even after an intense workout session.\n",
      "My daughter LOVES it! It is the perfect size so she can fit he folders, lunch bag and snow pants without stressing the zipper! She was thrilled cuz she get many compliments in school.\n",
      "This ink cartridge was everything I hoped for and then some. I was blown away by the fact that I actually received the product before I was even supposed to. Talk about speedy service! It was delivered with care and everything was just as it should be when I opened the box. I'm glad I bought this ink.\n",
      "This desk lamp was a great buy for me. Some of the cool features that I love about this lamp are; it's a 6-level Dimmer Table Lamp,  it's Touch-Sensitive Control Panel, it has Natural Light and Eye-protection Modern Design (L shape).\n",
      "I liked the compact and complete that is. In addition to that the material is of very good quality, and the parts will not rust or are grated with ease. I have to say that it is one of the best investments i've ever done. Very good.\n",
      "I am going to cry when this poor thing finally gives up the ghost. Not that it will do it any time soon though. It is a rugged bag.<br /><br />I put way too much stuff in it and still it looks good. It has compartments for everything.<br /><br />The double straps makes it comfortable to carry over your shoulder or in your hand. It makes a difference having this option. It makes the bag useable in all situations.<br /><br />I could not ask for a better bag.\n",
      "Never used a laser printer before, but put this toner in with no problems, just followed instructions on box. Toner works great, a great value, much cheaper than inkjet printers. No problems with ink output either. Great product!\n",
      "I bought this because I work in and around water a lot and I needed something to protect the lenses on my (expensive) sunglasses when I was not wearing them. They attach to the arms of the glasses via a tube of neoprene and although they are really easy to put on they actually stay put really well. They have a handy clip on the side to take off and put back on quickly which saves the fiddling with the sunglasses arms every time.<br /><br />Anyway, once on they are pretty comfortable and to be honest hardly noticeable. The most important thing is that they float if they fall off into water and can easily be seen from a long way off. Anyway, really pleased with mine.\n",
      "I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he absolutely Loves it! I love that it comes with the Android 4.0 Operating system and pre-loaded with applications and games. easy to use, he can use it himself and he loves it! I highly recommend it.\n",
      "I was hesitant to buy these because I was under the wrong impression that I needed cleats or studs to get good traction. But these funny little nubs work GREAT! I used them to walk back and forth from my truck to the ski lodge on ice and I could run & stop on a dime. I can't comment about using them for hiking, but if you're looking for keep from falling in your driveway, sidewalks, or wherever you may go throughout your day- these work very well!\n",
      "It sounds really good and it is verh practical and because it is water proof,I can take it in the shower leaving my phone outside in the counter and it picks up the music nice and clear,it was a great purchase.\n",
      "Because I am always not hearing the doorbell in the front hall, I bought two: one for the second floor hallway and one for the kitchen. I mounted the new push button ringer next to the old wired button ringer (which I left intact). I was pleasantly surprised with how nice this doorbell was. I can now hear the chimes no matter where I am. Chose 1Byone chimes. Works great.\n",
      "Cool set so far I have ever found. My childs are happy having it. They are always platying it in their play time.\n",
      "haha! tried and tested.  My wife shrieked!  It's just pure fun!.  These go up as Halloween decors soon.\n",
      "I love these movies. They are hilarious, silly, and make me laugh. I personally think Tyler Perry is a comedic genius. All of his movies are hilarious!\n",
      "Very satisfied with the performance of the camera. I was able to set it up on my phone as well which was very helpful. Needed to call customer service to get it all done as the guide book wasn't all that helpful Rocam support was super helpful and got me going. Thanks again.\n",
      "Good quality finger puppet and good for the kids. The texture is comfortable and each puppet is pretty awesome. The size is perfect. Nothing compares to niceEshop! Great product guys!\n",
      "This awesome infused water bottle is great because If you don't like water but know it's good for you and wish you had something to spice it up ..well this makes flavored water practically but it's all natural I love doing strawberry or lemons you can add more then one fruit. Its pretty neat and it's a great gift or great to buy for your self.\n",
      "My grip is very strong. But at the end of a workout it fades. These straps surely do hold up with my HEAVY lifts. Rep after rep of over 400 pounds and these things show no signs of ripping at all.<br /><br />Call me &#34;satisfied&#34; to say the least.<br /><br />- Satisfied a.k.a. Mbeja\n",
      "Love it! its make lots of task so simple for me. It has two universal sockets, i can use then for my ProBOOk, And the interesting thing it has a USB charging port. Its really makes cool this item. Easy to Cary, safe in use and hard enough to not break also working great.\n",
      "If you like firmer gelatin, jellos, cathedral window, and even cheesecake, then Knox is your go-to. Amazon delivers it fresh, not stale. Higly recommendable.\n",
      "This is just amazing. Easy to clean and completely non-sticky.<br />This is also durable so dont worry about it getting burned!<br />It also comes with money back guarantee so yeah!\n",
      "I have to say it is a very useful light.<br /><br />Firstly, it is 12 LED inside and the light and very pure white light, good to reading at night.<br />Secondly, it can fold completely and it is very useful for taking it out. You must take it to camping.<br />Third, 270 degree rotation is very funny and convenience. I cannot stop to turn it.<br />And the lightness can turn by touching the switch which is very impressed.<br />It is built-in 600mAH battery and last 7 hours with full charge. Usually I use it before sleeping so I only charge it about once a week.<br /><br />It looks so good when it stand on my desk. Love it so much.\n",
      "Great infuser. I am a gym guy so I take this with me to gym daily. It looks nice with me and keeps the water safe.\n",
      "I have fallen in love with this entertainment system!  I'd been looking for a system like this for a while.  This is a great blend, vintage look, new age feel.  The cabinets built with complete care and of the finest materials, this should last for a long, long time.  The turntables simply amazing!!!!  I show everyone who comes by my new stereo, you have to see this for yourself to completely understand how great this Ttable is. I would buy this again, HANDS DOWN the best on the market!\n",
      "I'm always the skeptic when it comes to these “get a workout fast” kind of things, but this time, I was shocked. I've tried my fair share of get ripped quick devices, mostly for entertainment, but this one is by far the one that actually does something.\n",
      "My wife saw these water stations being used  at the Irvine Pet Adoption Event in 2007, the year we adopted Sadie, our 3rd Lab rescue. They were set out around the venue to water the guests.  I thought they were a little pricey for a 5 gallon bucket but we were tired of those cheap 5 gallon Pet mate plastic jugs that kept breaking. And they are not that cheap once you break 5 or 6 of them. How can you clean the algae out of those things anyway?  But I digress, so If I was at work, my wife could barely lift that 5 gallon jug , invert it and plant it squarely into the base without breaking the jug or spilling water everywhere. So I bought a Critter Cooler and now I have two, one for inside one for outside, our daughter has a 3.5 gallon, our neighbor has one and we bought another 6.5 gallon and donated it to our local animal shelter. These things are awesome.. I love the little yellow plug so we can drain the bowl and clean the drool and gunk without wasting the water in the tank.. The wheels are high quality, at the Home Depot they would cost about $7 each. And when we got our daughter her Critter Cooler, it was missing a valve, so we called the company and the owner, James, called us back and apologized, sent the part priority mail that day and included a bottle of his dog shampoo. So great product and service and my wife was right again.\n",
      "It's not for the faint of hearts. If you can get past the bloody graphics, it is a totally awesome game.\n",
      "Very flexible to route anywhere and no sound distortion. Connectors fit snug and tight so should have no problems over time.\n",
      "I love these lights!! There are so many colors, the colors are bright. They either blink or slowly shift between colors randomly. Product was exactly what it describes, very satisfied with it.\n",
      "I have been buying bottled waters for the last 5 years. My husband and I tallied up what we spent and were stunned in how much we are spending. We purchased BluPure to help us save money in the long run. So far, the product has succeeded expectations with great tasting water. Now we bottle the water from our filter.\n",
      "Well ain't this a life saver &#60;3. It's compact and will fit easily in your home. Cools down the room pretty fast and well just like AC! Being student, I was looking for cooler which is not as costly as AC but could cool the room like it. This really does that. It doesn't cost that much of power either as I could see from my monthly bill. I never had any problem with it either during my so far tenure with it.\n",
      "This is the filter I needed and had no other options for filters for this engine and so I guess that makes this filter the best. IIt's great for what its intended to do.\n",
      "We have 4 dogs from all sizes and we do not want people to know this when they walk up in our yard, deck etc. This is amazing, it takes away all pet odor from outside. We have a blind dog that keeps on peeing on the cement walkway, we stay on top of it but one very quick rinse once or every other week takes away any odor and leaves it smelling so fresh. It really is a fantastic product!\n",
      "I totally recommend http://fave.co/1c3G1er  They look real from a distance, but I think when you're really close to them, they look basic. We hung our high. The stickers you get here are a nice touch.  http://fave.co/1bL2PyO  The only thing I would add to these is a battery for a red LED light. I had a camera as a kid that had 2 AA batteries that actually moved when it sensed motion... battery lasted over a year. I also recommend drilling a hole in the base of the mount, to feed the fake cord through on these, to make it look like the cord is being wired into the house. The fake cord as packaged (at least in mine) was just hanging off the camera.  My mom lives in a pretty small neighboorhood, though it is close to a few highschools. Every year when school gets out it seems like the neighborhoods around there get small break-ins, nothing major. Her house had her window broken into, stole small amount of money and that's it. I purchased these for her to place around the outside of her house, and the back garage.  She got this one first   http://fave.co/1bL2ufF  I got a set of these a few months ago and they are great. I came back to order more but they have changed the design! The older ones were actual casings from real cameras. This new design looks incredibly fake and too &#34;plasticky&#34;. Also, how many real cameras have the cheesy flashing red light? Almost none. If you do buy these, at least don't put in batteries for the light to flash...that's a dead giveaway that they are fake cameras. Unfortunately I will have to find another brand that isn't so obviously fake.  Side note...a little trick I like to do is to label my FOUR cameras 1, 4, 7, 9 etc...if someone is sniffing around and they can only find four, they will expect that the others have to be somewhere that they can't find.\n",
      "OK, so I've already  gone through 2 pop filters that I've previously purchased here on Amazon. They were pretty cheap and I figured it's all the same. NOPE! They broke apart and were flimsy it was ridiculous. I wasted my time and money with these things.<br />Enter the new guy (gv-pro 1) and I was pretty pessimistic but right out of the box (it's a pretty neat looking package) it already had a much more solid build and sturdy hold on my stand. I'm very happy with how it looks and holds up. Also, my recordings are crystal clear and I barely have to do any editing to clean up the audio!\n",
      "Found this unique monopod with built in battery charging for the Hero 4. Besides the great use of the monopod, I've to admit that it's inconvenient to replace my battery of my Hero 4 especially with the housing unit on it. This battery monopod allows my Hero 4 to shoot continuously without taking my Hero 4 out of the housing and replacing the battery. The large battery capacity definitely beats replacing standard batteries every time I run low on battery. Highly recommended.\n",
      "It is a good kit for gopro users and i do think the price is reasonable since the quality is great. This kit is one of the best buys on Amazon.Very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "As another reviewer stated, this isn't quite as elegantly shaped as it is pictured - it is a bit more angular. But, it looks MUCH better than all the plastic drop checkers that are available for similar prices. I'm not willing to pay what the real name brands want for a glass drop checker.\n",
      "I've bought a puppy named ceasar recently and it has lot of fleas and i didn't like to put anything toxic since it's a little puppy, but with this product i could see a clear difference, and ceasar just loves the smell\n",
      "One of the best quality by the category of lenses. This magnifier is just what I needed. It's much easier to read all the small fonts in a page now. good product. Using it on the daily basis and works very well. Also the value is cheap. Recommended to others. Thank you.\n",
      "I'm happy..!!! Because I got it for my Mother who is 90. She never could handle all the buttons you get now for cable tv, so thought she might like this. She does and it's been great for her. Finally she liked this.\n",
      "Me and my kids print daily. I have this computer program that allows them to draw and they can print out their art and they love it. However, it was becoming costly, so I decided to try this brand based on the cost. Wow, I was shocked. It is great quality and cost so much less.\n",
      "I love this product!  What a great idea!  I am a grandma now, but I made my own baby food when my sons were little using ice cube trays.  This is vastly superior.  The tray is stable from table to freezer.  The lid, though challenging at first, is actually easy to close once you get the hang of it.  Food pops easily out one at a time and the amount is very comparable to a baby food jar.  Love the recipes!  I'm keeping mine for when grandchildren visit, ice cubes, a multitude of usable situations, and I'm going to buy more for practical Baby Shower gifts!\n",
      "With the price these batteries come with, I must admit that this is an incredibly awesome deal. Its a great bargain considering that they are delivering great power and working just fine. Very awesome.\n",
      "This block set really surprised me! It is a great set for my son and would also make a great gift. I am keeping the box it comes in, because it is a nice box with a handle. Perfect for storing the blocks.\n",
      "This equipment is going to be used to film the walks on trials I go to a few times per week. Also thinking to use it for fly fishing! This Head Strap Mount is easy to use and a great accessory for the GoPro.\n",
      "I received Perfect Kitchen Envy BBQ Grill Mat the other night, it comes with two mats (both sides useable) and have used just one side of one of them three times!  They are easy to trim to the proportions of my grill, they don't stick to the grill, they are easy to clean properly and best of all, my food doesn't fall through the holes! :D  This aspect makes especially kabobs, smaller potatoes, vegetables, fish and other small stuff easy to manage on a grill!\n",
      "Sensitivity is great the remote works well and it gives you peace of mind with either a door chime or an alarm.I use it every day it works so good I sent for one more foe my back door..well made and work great\n",
      "This deal is a great alternative for the apple cable that is very expensive. I actually saved a fraction on these rather than having the expensive one. Had then in my workstation and in our house for quite a few weeks now, and it works perfect every time.\n",
      "I often go camping<br />But not until the mat is nateot really angry.<br />After this, I was delighted purchased this camping.<br />Is so good.\n",
      "This was a summer gift to myself. I barbeque a lot and a good set of grill tools is always needed. My old ones were getting worn out and it was time to get a new set. I really like the look of these and after using them I can tell they are top quaslity. They are sturdy and seem like they will last a while. I tlike that they arent wood. The wood one sometimes worry me about bacteria and what not. Being all stainless I dont worry as much.\n",
      "Smaller can be better, especially when you are talking about a device that is intended to be on the compact side of things. This iPad dock is small enough to easily move it about, either in the house or taken in a bag on the road. The included remote control means no more having to stand up to change volume or pause. The dock even has audio outputs so that it can become a part of an audio system while watching movies or video.<br /><br />As a charging port it's factory grade and doesn't overcharge. Use it while charging. The base is stable for being as small as it is. This dock is simply operated and fills my need.\n",
      "My mom gave this cage to me.  My sugar glider has lived in this for awhile and has lots of room to jump and play. It's nice as the cage can come off the base if not required; and when it's on the base it feels very sturdy. Our cats have climbed it quite a few times and never has fallen over either. The surfaces are easy to clean and disassemble if needed and the quality has been great. I been debating to buy a second one for a bird cage possibly.\n",
      "I was looking for a reasonable dual headphone-microphone headset and I read somewhere about the I65<br />Read also the Amazon reviews and I thought that, for the price, it was worth the try, and I am certainly very satisfied.<br />It reduces outside noise reasonably well and the sound is decent enough to enjoy what you are listening.<br />So, for the relationship price - usefulness-sound quality, I give it 5 stars.\n",
      "I needed a durable fitness sports watch to monitor my heart rate and time myself during reps.  This one does both of those things for me, and it's also sweat and water resistant, which is great for during the work out, and for after the work out when I cool off in the pool.  I thought the watch might actually get in the way when I'm lifting, but, actually, I've yet to notice it and it's made from very comfortable material.\n",
      "It is a very helpful and nice product.  It is made of high quality lightweight Aluminum material. It is a 45 degree angled fitting through it oil, fuel and water can go.  It also lasts long time. It has removable head for twist lock applications.\n",
      "This wall mount made things pretty easy. For starters, it comes with a level. Also, the holes make for marking the wall quick. Add some toggle bolts, clip on the tv and you are ready to rumble.\n",
      "I have 3 dogs, enough said. All of them are technically short hair but one is a retriever mix so there is a golden glow to the house. Having used brushes in the past, I thought I just had to live with this. When I received the Hair Hero I was impressed by its design-- it felt so good in my hand. I started right in on the retriever and wow! I could not believe the pile of fur it produced. Thunder looked like a different dog and he was dancing around, coming back for more. (???) Seeing this, the other 2 lined up for their turn. I wasn't expecting much from their coats, but again, a surprising amount of fur. Another surprise, they were so shiny. So, needless to say I am totally sold on this product.\n",
      "amazing and comfortable for my work out process has became somewhat reliable with this product as its really comfortable to use and its really durable for builders who wanna work out without missing even a day.\n",
      "I don't think this game is good for smaller aged-children, but I do think it's a great strategy game for kids around 10 years old and older. This is an excellent family game that always seems to change each time you play it. The game is survival, and the analytical skills needed to play the game makes this a good learning tool for the kids. I love the Settlers games and hope they make many more.\n",
      "I was really happy with this purchase. Not only was the installation hassle-free, but the way this product is designed and the fact that it's paintable, it enabled it to blend in quite nicely with my home. If you're looking for a lineset cover, I would certainly recommend this one.\n",
      "Received this belt as a birthday gift and didn't think much of it until my old belt finally wore out.  Very comfortable, smooth and sturdy... I never thought that way about a belt until I started wearing this one.  High-quality craftsmanship in every way, just as you would expect from this brand.\n",
      "i love the ring very much can beat the price for a real sapphire and white topaz  stones real sterling sliver\n",
      "Upgraded my iPod Touch after quite a few years and this is a joy to use! Great screen, nice and slim, I love the slightly rectangular type edges that give it a nice sleek look and a good grip. Screen quality is like no other screen I have seen. Awesome, just awesome!\n",
      "Why didn't I buy one of these sooner?! It saves SO much time. I've run into a couple wires where it doesn't catch on the first try, it just strips it a little but. But, a little hand adjustment using the screw on the front fixes that. It even has a wire cutter on the upper part of the handle - we cut electrical wires with ease. This this is heavy duty - spend the extra money, and you'll be so glad you did.\n",
      "I am very in love with the design of this dress. I love the front how it is a v neck and has a little gap at the bottom making it look like a champagne glass with the stem. The v neck design in the back is perfect for me I like open back dresses but some are just to open and reveal to much skin. It is form fitting up top and flares out as it descends your body. The quality and price is amazing you cannot beat it or find better anywhere else.\n",
      "I installed the inverter in my RV. There is decent space there for ventilation - but no more than 6 inches on each side and a few feet on the back. This inverter can handle many things at once. It run almost all my gadgets at same time. 1100 watts are good enough to play DVD player and a TV using a 10 foot extension cord and it works great, I can also charge my cell phone and other devices simultaneously. Great product great price. I ordered the extra cables that are needed to run the unit any distance to the battery by the way. The small clamps that came with it will not cut it for installation at any distance away from the battery.\n",
      "This salmon oil is great for any kind of dog at any age.. If you love your dog like I do then you want your dog to live a long healthy life and with this your dog will get all the vitamins and nutritions they need\n",
      "I wasn't really watching about vampires and all. But this one got me. I just watched this first season and I am planning to watch the next season. I guess I am becoming addicted to it. It was really thrilling and not full of drama that's why I like it. Soon to watch the next one!\n",
      "I absoutly love this leash i love how the string part feels like ribbon and makes it better for my little dog when he gets his self wrapped up in it . It go about 13ft which is a perfect amout for my dog to walk around and do his business . i like to take my dog on bike rides and have him running beside me as i am going down the road and with other leashes it was hard with him cause it would get wrapped up and he would yelp or the button would get stuck and then eventually the string wouldnt retract any more . with my go pet it has made are outside activities a blast\n",
      "Satisfied with its quality. The images seem clear and better than some others I bought. The microphone is very sensitive, talking is smoothy through the camera.\n",
      "This is a great lamp. It has a bright light and it looks great wherever you put it in the room. It's easy to setup too.\n",
      "This solar light is just the answer if you want an inexpensive means of lighting up an out of the way area and don't want to go to the time and expense of wiring up to the mains supply. I've been using this light for several months now inside my garden shed. It's lightweight and easy to assemble. A sensor detects the movement of the door opening and the light instantly comes on, hence no more fumbling around, one-handed with a torch!\n",
      "The pump works very well for transferring fuel from a portable gas can. I found it to be super handy, easy to use and reliable. It also pumps fairly quickly for a portable battery operated pump. Just a great product.\n",
      "This product is really awesome.!!

I don''t know if it works, but so far no cold or flu.So, I suggest this to anyone with kids or as a gift.\n",
      "My son loved this toy, which was one of his Christmas presents. Its really good quality and goes over small obstacles and inclines with ease. I've bought other cheap R/C cars from ebay before but they don't last. This one runs really well and we get quite a decent run out of one set of batteries. Loads of fun and great value for money.\n",
      "So, we are in the midwest and the weather has been miserable. Thankfully this is a well made scrapper that has definitely been put to the test this winter. It works great and is well priced.\n",
      "I am in a local swim meet and therefore do a lot of swimming and spend a lot of time in the water.  I have gone through many different nose clips and plugs trying to find the right ones.  While I have come across some others that do the job, they just did not last long.  I have had these for a while now and they have lasted double what they others have.  If you are looking, definitely give these a try!\n",
      "The lights are excellent, i have them set against my backwall and two trees and they look so pretty at night. They light up automatically at night which is great.\n",
      "So, here's the thing. This tea was recommended to me by a friend, and I was unsure about it at first.<br /><br />Then I did some research and I liked what I found. It is all natural, and nothing is added to it. I love tea anyway, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I have to say, I really like it.<br /><br />I decided that I would commit to switching out coffee or soda and drink the tea instead to see how I feel. So far it has been great. I have lost weight, but even more than that, I just generally feel better.<br /><br />I plan on sticking with it, and will report back with more results.\n",
      "I use it all the time and the battery seems to last forever, would definitely buy more. Especially to give as gifts, I feel like anyone can get use out of them.\n",

      "I had never seen this show before but the price was too good to pass on.  It's pretty rare to find a season of a show selling for under ten bucks.  I find prison life documentaries very entertaining, and this show is no different.  I'm excited to check out the other seasons.\n",
      "Easy to wash. It looks awesome on me. I mainly purchased this for wearing at the office, but now I found I can wear it on many occasions also.\n",

      "This is a great gadget, really a must-have! I bought this so I know what my child is doing in his room over day. This makes me have a safe feeling because he is in his room all day on his pc. I can now sit in my sofa downstairs and I don't have to worry about my son anymore. The quality is very good, and I really like the way it works, everything is so smooth and handy!\n",
      "Works quite well, bought 2 and both are good. didn't know I can't listen on 2 headsets on Bluetooth at once (not the suppliers issue, it's the Bluetooth protocol). Wound up listening to travel guides on our trip w/ wired headphones and splitter so my wife and I were on the same page in museums and such. Using this headset for walking and mowing. The earbud on the side w/ the receiver/ switch keeps falling out due to the weight but I have not tried the different ear plugs supplied. Volume switch could be more prominent from the body of the control, hard to find by feel.\n",
      "Even at my age, I still use headphones as a noise cancelling device, particularly if there are things I don't want to hear.\n",
      "These rings are awesome. The rings are very well made, which makes for a comfortable grip.These Straps are strong as hell and so is the buckle and Rings.These rings work great and are really durable.Overall, I'd say it's a great product at a great price.\n",
      "These provide excellent for lighting outside deck stairs. During the summer months they will remain lit all night. Note, in standby mode they shine a nice dim light. When motion is detected, they go to high power as long as movement is detected, or approximately 30 seconds. During winter months, they will operate for several hours, but run out of power before dawn; this isn't an issue for me. They do need several hours of direct sunlight in order to recharge the batteries.\n",
      "As it says, it will help you to keep your shirt tucked. This product is amazing because is comfortable at the moment, it really keeps my shirt tucked  in and the stretchable elastic doesn't break or something like that, it just reach your foot and it doesn't mind how tall or small you are, this will help you. Is very versatile because you can use it in two different ways, the straight style or the footloop style. Amazing, 5 stars.\n",

      "We all want the convenience of printing whatever we want at home, for whatever reason, but most of us cringe at the price of ink. If you are like me, you watch the ink level drain with each print and finally stop printing at all. Well,this ink is the solution to printing INEXPENSIVELY at home and not worrying about the ink.\n",
      "awesome product very good finishing .due to a small house i cant afford an extra space so this thing satisfy our need\n",
      "I own a small business and strive to look as professional as possible. I use this to print the address labels for my invoices. It looks so much better than something hand written. The software makes it easy to add and keep addresses for future use. I am extremely happy with it.\n",
      "Definitely a must-have in every home and vehicle! Very bright and really sturdy, this has helped me through several vehicle breakdowns (when you drive a 96 Corolla, you might especially want one of these) and blackouts. It would be great to invest in these and makes sure that you have light when you need it.\n",
      "there is nothing like having a great sticking chalkboard, I had my sticky chalkboard sticking in near my closet and I had written my 10 top plans that I want to accomplish this year, I copied the Idea from a book called the secret and maybe it will work for me.<br />The chalkboard helps keep me track on the goals that I wish to fulfill, and the best part is having these colored chalks and with these colors I can made some interesting and beautiful designs that would make this chalkboard more interesting\n",
      "This keeps everything in one place and doesn't rattle around in the dishwasher.  I like how you can fit the nipples in the top part and all other items can go in the basket. Great small basket to hold all the bottles and pump accessories.\n",
      "it seems like every time we get a pillow for my border collie she tears/chews it up. This mat she hasn't tore up. It is very durable and strong ,plus soft enough to ease older dogs and cats. My dog seems to have trouble walking probably due to arthritis and it seems to be helping a lot. If i get another dog i'll definitely buy another one.\n",
      "I wasn't expecting this to be as good as the first two but, really, it is the best of the three. Good, touching story. I just rented it but am going to buy it on payday.\n",
      "Used the same pot with the water at the same starting temperature, and guess what. This little stove only took 35 seconds longer to get the water to a ROLLING boil. My tablet stove never got above a simmer and steam.The fins which hold the pot above the burner, make sure you FOLD THE TOP OUT before placing your pot on top. Don't try to cook with the fins folded in like the picture for the product.The igniter for this thing is such a very nice addition.\n",
      "As expected of case logic, this one is really well-built and durable. I've had this collection of all types of CDs way back in high school and I don't want to throw them away so I bought this one. I had no problem putting and securing each one in place.\n",

She bikes to her yoga studio and she really likes that she can put everything she needs in the bag - mat, keys, water bottle, towel, etc. It's a great design and I'm going to order one for myself now!\n",
      "Awesome quality for good price. Hooked up to DVR unit and worked right, good pictures for day and night.\n",
      "Used this portable power bank at an outdoor vendor booth that did not have power hookups. I ran my laptop, my phone charged, a fan, and a light and it held a charge for 7 hours. I didn't need to use the solar panels, but had them on hand just in case. It was perfect because it fit underneath the table an was silent.\n",
      "We have a little terrier, and she lives out at day. But she was terrified to go outside, especially at nighttime. So we got Dog Potty with REAL grass pad for her and our convenience.They do need to be cleaned every few days. No messes and we can peacefully live together. Once she understood that was where she was to go, and it is in the laundry room. She goes to it easily without any fuss.\n",
      "We HIGHLY recommend looking, and even getting http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00NFETB9Y  We had a wind up mobile before purchasing this one and hated it. THIS one http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B005F21DA4  This mobile is wonderful. I think the baby especially likes the projection. The first time we turned it on, our 2 month old smiled and smiled. The remote control is handy and I love that it plays for 20 minutes.   I don't know how long the batteries will last, but it is so much better than the wind up kind I don't care. It was easy to install on the crib and is very secure. I wish there were more volume settings (it has two). Even on the loudest setting it is kinda quiet. I would definitely purchase this mobile again or buy it for other future mothers for a shower gift.  We just put batteries in it last night, and I am in love with it!! So here it is from baby's eye view. :)  The only downside: the tiny screwdrivers that are needed for assembly. I had to search through my husbands computer kit to find one that was small enough.  In short, get the http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00NFETB9Y  I hope this review was helpful!\n",
      "At least it doesn't leak unlike the one that I got last time. I slipped and nearly broke my tailbone because of it.\n",
      "I have been picking up cabinets and nick knack shelves at goodwill for years, but after a lot of broken treasures I decided to try a better cabinet. This was without a doubt worth the money. Not only are the shelves inside very sturdy, but you can even put some little picture frames or nick knacks on top of the cabinet. It holds a great deal of weight and doesn't budge a bit. All of the mirrors inside make everything you put in look great.\n",
      "This product has surpassed my expectations and it is, as my son likes to say, really cool. The design itself is quite versatile and I can put it wherever in the house I want. But when on a Sunday, this sits right be the table to accompany some good ribs, steaks and burgers.\n",
      "It's really really cute and sturdy, I just put my cellphone,wallet,small notebook and keys inside to go some shopping malls and coffeehouse with my college classmates, even it is a small bag that can not hold too much things, I still like its light weight and funny look. This is a play bag just right meet my need. Love it!\n",
      "These do fits perfectly and as I expected them to be. Usually when I get the same size it's like they're not going fit close and comfortable enough for me. I love the fact that I can rock these any everywhere no matter what. These are simply perfect enough for me. The material is amazing and you can tell that they are of good quality.\n",
      "Seriously, $6.95. I wasn't expecting much but after playing around with the antenna I managed to get more channels than I had before so I have absolutely 0 complaints. Will have to wait and see how long it lasts but at this price, who cares, I can just get another one!\n",
      "I love the design, it looks nice, and works well,<br /><br />I do not have any problems, it really worth the cheap price, but the product is not cheap at all.<br /><br />This complete a modern shower!!\n",
      "I have tried and tested a lot of swimming cap from different brands before and this was my favorite. This brand makes durable products, I personally own a goggles made by the same company and I really love it. Try this cap and see the difference, I found it very comfortable to use, easy to wear and take off, it doesn't hurt my scalp by pulling hairs off, colors are lovely and the price is very affordable. I recommend it!\n",
      "My dogs love these. They smell nice and are a perfect size for the vast majority of dogs. If you had a very tiny toy breed you can easily break these in half without them crumbling too bad. My dogs get crazy excited whenever they hear the bag crinkling!\n",
      "This spray really goes a long way and serves so many purposes for my pup! I initially ordered the Probiotics to help with my puppy's slight odor problem. I smelled the difference as soon as I sprayed it on her and it made her coat more shinier which is definitely a plus. What really makes me love this product so much is that it also took away her bad breath, so much better than the doggy treats I buy to treat her bad breath. Overall, I'm loving this spray and will continue use it  to see how much it can help my cute little pup!\n",
      "I bought a pack of this before and that's it. I am a chocolate lover and I love the idea of alcohol being mixed in it. Plus they're really cute!!! I was lucky enough to receive a set of this from a dear friend 2 months ago and I still haven't opened it! I just find them too precious that I don't want to devour them!!!! Shocks.\n",
      "The official is the perfect, but if you can't find that one, you can go for this one blindfolded, it works same as the original one and if anyone is not happy with the product, no worries Amazon is giving the funds back, by the way, I am happy with mine, no need to refund.\n",
      "I was having troubles with my cat wanting to poop in his litter box and it turns out it was the litter. I purchased this litter and haven't had any issues since. Its very clean and seems to hold the odor if left for a couple days. I especially like that it doesn't leave a fine residue around the litter box area like some other brands.\n",
      "These are simply fantastic!  They neatly fit into my luggage. No more &#34;Can't find my socks or under garments amongst my other clothes or cosmetics buried in my extra pair of shoes. No more wrinkly blouses! Thank you thank you! This is a must for any traveler like myself. Also, When not traveling they can also be used to keep closets and drawers organized.\n",
      "These glow sticks were a great addition to my glow in the dark party. I also just laid them out all over the tables for decorations.\n",

I used this wire to run a cable from my router to a bed room taped to the floor and it worked just fine!\n",

A great price and so far, a great product! It is amazing how much it will heat up the surrounding area. Very comfortable to sit around and relax on a cool evening. The temps are just starting to come down as fall approaches here now and we have used it a few times on our deck so far.\n",
      "I like it very much, because of good quality and cheap, buy products consistent with what you want, I'll tell my friend recommended!!!!!\n",
      "This towel is very smooth and silky and takes in substances with ease. Therefor this is good as it allows you to cool down very quick by taking as much heat energy you produce out of your body. The price and quality of the product together works well because the quality is so good the price is as well.\n",

      "http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/1633440303 is a game for two players set in the dystopian future of Android . It pits monolothic megacorps against subversive netrunners in a high-stakes struggle for the control of valuable data.  With its sixty cards (a complete playset of twenty-two different cards), The Valley explores Biotech Valley and its massive investment into bleeding-edge bioengineering.   This is a meatspace heavily colored by genengineering, a highly educated workforce, tech startups, capital investments, and the presence of Jinteki’s J-Plex. You’ll find numerous assets, region ugrades, genetic resources, and a new Jinteki identity. Of course, even in the Valley, you’ll need more than good genes to get by; you’ll also find new programs, ice, and currents for both Corps and Runners.  I recommend checking out http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/1633440303  I hope this review was helpful!\n",
      "I bought it for my 3-year-old son and he did like it very much. I can see that he loves to draw houses and animals.  He is having so much fun. As a parent, I enjoyed watching him doing his thing. I can say it's worth every penny. I am just glad I bought this.\n",
      "Great price and good quality.These mats are cute, inexpensive and durable. They look fine and they don't move easily.I thought they would slip around in my floor because they were so thin but they stay in place in the front.A great value and really dressed up the interior. I buy these mats every year for the winter because I don't want the muddy snow to stain my floors.\n",
      "I love this Cooler, i bought it for me and my girlfriend, she loves it too, we go out to picnic and it conserve the ice pretty good, we can have cold beer, and fresh lettuce for sandwiches. i say buy it and enjoy it. Most people wants a regular cooler, but this is the best one, even the design is great.\n",
      "For fills my requirements and thank you. It was just the right size bag I have been looking for, thanks again.\n",
      "Invaluable to my studies. I have a white board which I use to throw on important information, but it is not large enough for one exam's content, no matter how succinct I try to be. Getting an extra board was expensive and I didn't want to drill another pair of holes into my rental, so I found this stick-on chalkboard. Half of it is already almost twice as large as my whiteboard, and it only took me a couple of  minutes to throw it on the wall. I was a bit worried that it was a &#34;one shot deal&#34; with regards to putting it on perfectly, but readjusting or moving it around is no problem; no sticky residue to worry about as this seems to adhere by static.\n",
      "I bought this about two months ago for my LCD flat screen and guess what..I am actually extremely happy with my purchase.Perfect built..good quality of wood...well polished.sturdy and above all affordable.\n",
      "Love these headphones. I bought them last August and have been using them for couple of months with no issues at all. Nice quality of sound at a surprisingly low cost.\n",
      "I was worried about its quality by reading the previous reviews. I had even thought about a return issue. I ordered this as a birthday gift to my son. He has a DJI F550 hexacopter. If it did not work well, I have no other choice but return. However, my son loved it. He always do the assembly for those things, so it was quite a easy thing for him to put this kit on his hexacopter. The parts were not flimsy, but quite solid. It had strong legs. The mounts are made by alumimum. That was a reason I chose this, because it really looked better than those made by cheap plastic.And its color sexied up the quad's looks, was pretty as the descritiopns. And it had a battery tray and camera gimbal holder, quite convenience. My son loves it, and I love too. Recommended.\n",
      "This camera is the best available. Camera picture was amazing during the day. At night recommend buying the brightest light you can have for reverse. The camera needs help when doing night back up. The night picture is grainy at best but is improved with upgraded lights. The camera is water proof I have already put it through a car wash.\n",
      "The remote also has a flashlight option which has proven handy for those night walks to the dog park. Shipping was fast! Only TWO Days. I would highly recommend this product for the first time collar user. He has an extremely thick coat and long hair and the long hair prongs work well. We do have to have it tighter than his normal collar to reach his skin but he listens to the beep or the vibrate settings. The battery on the collar will last a couple of days and the remote can go almost a week. I do wish there was another charger so I can charge them at the same time but they do charge quickly.\n",
      "Used it to prime rusty railing. Adheres well, dries fast. Just clean the brush right away after use. Don't let the brush dry out with this stuff still on it. Very hard to clean even with solvent. I paid the prize for being lazy, I guess.\n",
      "This sticker is in high quality. Very easy to apply because it comes along with an instruction. Looking good and very pleased with it!\n",
      "I undesrtand why this wouldn't be on the top of the coffee must haves, the name seems to put some people off. No it doesn't taste like jet fuel, although I havent tried one yet mself but I can say this tastes more like some really good coffee. I used to drink Organic but it doesn't seem to be available anymore. I drank it because I liked the taste, not because of the name. I've tried other X-bold K-cups but this seems to be the one I always end up buying.\n",
      "My older dog and 2 cats love this mat and use it all the time. Very much pleased and Would highly recommend it to all of my friends.\n",
      "I found Hiline while looking for a good price and alternatives to Nespesso. I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did! Coffee from Hiline has nice aroma and most importantly the lively, fresh and bold taste. Actually, a couple of weeks ago I've been sent a new blend - Greenwich Village, which is new and I did not had a chance to find it on Amazon (packaging with macaroons in a brown bag) OMG! It's beautiful! They definitely know how to make good coffee. I'll be waiting for the official launch!\n",

      "I have a friend who is a librarian, I know he's going to LOVE these cards. He's always sending note cards and these couldn't be more perfect.\n",
      "I'm surprised when I bought this one as its size is smaller than the other Quadcopters I have at home.<br /><br />At first I find it difficult to control because it has more sensitivity than other quadcopters I've used so far, but eventually after using it for 3 times, I managed to adjust myself on it. And I find it amazing, as it was my first time controlling a copter than can do a 360 trick.<br /><br />About the battery, so the lifetime is your average one where the charging time is longer than the playing time, but even so, I really liked this quadcopter so I decided to bought another 3 sets of battery so I can play it longer. Also when it comes to price, it was really cheap than your typical RCs and it was also ready to fly from the box where I find annoying in other brands where it took me few minutes or hours to set up the RC.\n",
      "Very nice leather and good quality paper. Was a wonderful gift. This product was exactly what I was expecting. I would order again.\n",

      "It's amazing to me that you can get four, very nice mechanical pencils for hardly any money at all and if you check the price, you'll see that it is hardly any money. These pencils feel good in the hand, are well built and would be a deal at twice the price. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Got this for my nephew for christmas He loves it. At first it was hard connecting it to the ipad app but once we figured it out he had hours of amusement ahead of him. Theyre no where near the furbys i had as a kid but theyre pretty cool!\n",

      "I must admit it is well built and durable. I literally sweat a half liter in the first use at night, after walking for about an hour. Sizing is a bit on the small size so u would recommend buying a size larger than u normally wear. But I will recommend this to anyone looking for a sweat.\n",
      "I like these candles, they are not messy to clean up after and they give out a nice soft light. They are very attractive with the different colors. The remote is a bonus also.\n",

      "These pair of headphones are the bomb! I like the reaction I get from my friends when they think they're just regular headphones, until I flip out the earpieces and they instantly turn into speakers, kind of like a cool magic trick! Definitely recommend these headphones.\n",
      "I got this mostly for the novelty, but it turned out to be a lot more useful than I could have expected it to be. It's bright, goes well with my desk and most of all, it is very, very cheap. I like this kind of cheap thing.\n",
      "I've seen these over the years and always wanted a set to help stop the rocking of our 5th wheel. This was, by far, the best price and standard shipping was great. I also like the quick release feature as it saves TONS of time. This was something that I didn't see on other chocks. The price on these is incredible and the are very well built. I hope you enjoy these as much as I have!\n",
      "I bought this for my 10 year old son and he absolutely loved it. The controller is easy to use and the helicopter flies pretty high. My son uses this in the backyard and takes it to go camping and the beach. The toy is extremely durable and portable. It has a light that flashes and the battery life is pretty long. My son couldn't be any happier with this toy. In fact, my husband plays with it as well. Shipping was fast and I plan on buying one more for my nephew for his upcoming birthday\n",
      "I have been trying to find a solution for the mess in the back of my van for a long time and this was SOOOO the answer! This can hold the brake fluid in one pocket and one pocket for the jumper cables and one pocket for anything you can think of and a pocket for my 13 yr old daughters books and whatever she has hauled around an left in the car!! I still have a ton of room for my groceries and I love the sticky pads that attach to the seat so that it doesn't swing out either! Love it!\n",

      "Colin Quinn was really dry and offbeat on Saturday Night Live and I hadn't seen any of his standup until this. It's an amazing performance piece, with the history of mankind broken down into a series of vignettes that use modern behavior to explain how we developed over thousands of years. Essentially riffing on how absurd our behavior is when we're combative and tribal, Quinn somehow manages to hold the thing together throughout, and there's a good laugh about every 25 seconds, which by any show's standards is good. I'd put this up there with Will Ferrell's George Bush one-man show, but add that in doing it as a simple monologue with a backdrop of slides about the places and nations he's discussing, Quinn pulls off a more difficult routine just as well.\n",
      "It was worth every penny carrying this with me with 4 recent flights I took. It worked perfectly well with my ariplane seatbelt. I have a belly and it fit perfectly and comfortably. Very good quality too. I would buy it again and again.\n",

I chopped the broccoli, dumped it in the blender, added the water to the tank, and set the dial to steam. Using the blender the broccoli pureed perfectly. Simple! After using it it went right into the dishwasher. The best part is that I can use if for more than just baby food.\n",
      "I used them mostly on semi-precious stones and some seaglass. The bits worked quick and well. Much better than the twisted ones.  If you have a press, it would be the ideal way to drill. But hand drilling will also work. You have to be drilling under water. Otherwise, bits won't last long.<br /><br />Drilling such tiny holes in any kind of material is not an easy thing to do.  If you don't know what you are doing, you will break a lot of bits.  But hey, you have 30 bits to practice, so good luck!\n",
      "My kids (6 yo and an 8 yo) just love dinosaurs, t-rex in specific! So I just had to get them this cool, lighting up dino lego for them. It got delivered a day before the estimated time of arrival so an A+ for they're service. As for the quality, I would actually give it an A++!<br /><br />On delivery, I unboxed the structure and checked for any missing block or proper instruction. As I have had a pretty bad experience with a few other lego set I bought earlier. I checked to make sure and this had no issue at all, and the quality of the plastic was superb!<br /><br />Getting through with the unboxing and the checkup, me and the boys first tried to make the model on our own, with no success, I downloaded their video guide. I was no hard to find as they had it on their website. The video explain a few thing we were doing wrong and voila. the t-rex was up and lit at its best! I was honestly very impressed with this laser pegs. It was a great fun to put it together with the boys. Now both of them play with it together, and make the rest of the 23 dinosaur models on their own!\n",

      "They say that PG Tips black tea is the number one brand in Britain. One taste will certainly show you why.  This is rich and full of flavor. I think that even if you are not really a big tea drinker this would be the perfect brand to try. This totally blows away anything that you are likely to find here in the supermarket. You will also appreciate the fact that the flavor and consistency produced by this brand is one of the better that you will find. It is very nice for drinking every day.<br /><br />Of course, there are also those times when you want to add a little bit of variety to things. In that case, might I suggest taking a look at this item: [[ASIN:B00HC582FQ Organic Black Teas Loose Tea Trio Sampler - Earl Grey Crème, Sweet Almond Wild Berry, Sweet Hot Cinnamon (2 Oz) + Free Stevia (5 Grams)]]<br /><br />This one gives you some interesting black tea choices. Although I had heard about Earl Grey tea from watching Captain Picard in Star Trek: TNG, actually trying this was quite amazing. For those times when I want something a bit spicy, I really go in for the sweet hot cinnamon. The other option is tea that combines almonds with a fruit flavor finish--you will end up loving this! Try these today.\n",

      "I believe this is the same product as the  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B003AKF4EE  I decided to replace the rollers after one of my garage springs broke. The original rollers were nylon but did not have any bearings. The repair technician showed me the easiest way to replace them. Take a vise grip plier and bend out the metal side track about 2 inches after the curve from vertical to horizontal.  Which is sold by Sanford and Son Overhead Doors too. The only difference is that these are sealed bearings.  For the bottom roller, bend out a section of track 6 inches before the bend from vertical to horizontal. Align the bottom roller to the open section of the track pop out the roller and replace it. Bend back the track.  Align one of the rollers and use a large screwdriver between the track and side of the roller to pop the roller out of the track. Of course you will have to hold up the section of the garage door. Replace the old roller and pop in the new roller into the track. Repeat for the rest of the rollers except for the bottom roller. Use the plier and bend back the track.  This will be the easiest way rather than pulling out the side rails or removing the hinges.\n",

They also work as a jello mold. The rectangular Lego mold pieces are 1&#34; X 2&#34; The men come in 3 sizes: 1.5&#34; 2&#34; and one tall 4&#34; man.

A real cctv is too expensive though and maintenance is the rest of the iceberg. Then I've found this! I \"installed\" it somewhere my brother would be too lazy to climb up to and check. Well, it worked! The motion activation and red light makes it look so real! My things seems intact and untouched since then. ha!\n",
      "My husband needed to replace his old wallet (it was falling apart!) and wanted something a little different than the traditional tri-fold wallets he usually bought. This wallet is exactly what he was looking for. It has just enough space for his various cards, his cash (you have to fold it), and a few other little things. This wallet is rigid, which he loves, and he feels pretty certain that his wallet items will be well protected.<br /><br />I'm not sure how the RFID protection works, but it's a feature that he wasn't concerned with. He just wanted a new wallet, and we found this little beaut. I'm sure the RFID protection is handy, and if it's ever needed that his cards will be safe and sound.\n",
      "LOOK!!! If your looking for the real thing than BUY IT!!!  This is an ELECTRIC drum kit and with regards to anyone who thinks this will replace their \"REAL\" kit, i hate to break it to ya but nothing sounds as good as the real thing no matter how much money you spend.  If you want a practice set for jammin out and having fun doing it this is probably a good choice.  I play guitar a little and wanted to try my hand at the drums. I looked at a used set of drums costing 450 at Guitar Center; this was better as it was new and cost less.   As a starter set the kit is perfectly fine and works they way it should.  Although i wouldn't call this a replacement kit, I would recommend it.\n",

[Un]fortunately I had the opportunity to try this product out on one of those &#34;somethings&#34; and it does the job better than the other 3 or 4 sprays we had in the house (had, because they're not in the trash).

I bought it for my five year-old niece and it quickly became an adventure for her and the entire family.<br /><br />The caterpillars were delivered promptly. All five were alive and soon began eating themselves silly. The chrysalides formed in a matter of hours after just a couple days of eating. A few days later, they hatched overnight into gorgeous Pink Ladies.<br /><br />What a wonderful way to teach children (and adults!) about the miracle and fragility of life.<br /><br />The house itself is durable and well-made and the educational materials that accompany it are clear and informative.<br /><br />One tip if you do buy this item: Keep an eye on them. They grow up so fast! Taking pictures of their different stages might be good for a elementary school science project, too.\n",

      "I always like to order my water with lemon in restaurants, lime or a slice of orange. At home I also do the same thing - just squeeze a wedge of lemon or lime and drop it in the glass. Sometimes it is just so hard to try and drink the recommendation amount of daily water when you are drinking it &#34;straight up&#34;. Now with the Fruit Infused Water Bottle by Acquablend I am able to load up infuser tube with lots of fruits and just refill the bottle and enjoy flavored water all day long.  I really like that this bottle is transparent and you can see what is inside. It has a wide mouth instead of a spout. As you drink you can smell the delicious aroma of the fruits from the infused chamber. The caps also seals to a leak proof seal. 100 percent BPA-free and dishwasher safe.  Fill it with anything you want. My favorites are grapefruit, lemons, limes, strawberries, oranges, raspberries and passion fruit seeds (crushed a little bit). You can really make you imagination go wild with this bottle. Your only limits are the fruits you have in the house. Overall its a great product and I am very happy with this purchase !!\n",

What's the point in filtered water if the filter itself is befouled?<br /><br />Easy to use for the kids, even, and they also like it because it looks cool. Which also sold my wife on it even though she was already there because of how it worked!\n",

I enjoy building the 16 space fighters set with him (thanks to the simple and easy instructions which came with it) and it’s a great fun.

I would surely recommend this to all the dads out there looking for a quality fun with your kids.\n",
      "Awesome item！！！Bicycle phone mount and Goporo handlebar mount 2 in 1.I have snowmobiles, bikes, motorcycles, etc. and have bought multiple types of GULAKI mounts across them to hold my iPhone, Go-pro camera, and other things.

      "I'm not a big fan of how much sugar it takes to make Koolaid, but I love flavored water.  I like Crystal Light, but it can get expensive sometimes. Splenda makes me nauseated.  I can use almost a whole bottle of Mio on two cups of water. So, that wasn't a good deal either.  When I heard of the power of Stevia to actually sweeten, I decided to give it a try. I got the watermelon flavored kind and now can't stop using it.  It really sweetens and has an awesome taste! Just a few drops and you've got a great tasting beverage.\n",

I had been looking at stores and online for weeks trying to find the best quality at the best price. I was very impressed with the quality, luster and shape was all that was promised and most importantly my fiancée loves it. I was doubtful at first because I wasn't sure if the product was going to be of good quality but after I opened it and held the necklace in my hands, there is no doubt in my mind that what I purchased is real and of good quality. You can feel it in the weight of the pearls and the beautiful color. Just to think that these wonderful orbs came from Mother Nature is a privilege on its own. My fiancé loved it and she is going to look gorgeous on our wedding day\n",
      "I've been using Epson products for forever and have never been disappointed. First off, if you ever (and it's rare that you have to) need to call their customer service, they are informative and friendly and second off, Epson just plain builds great products. This printer married quickly with my iMac and is working as it should. But the crème de la crème with this printer is the beautiful copies. You can get printers for not much money all over the place these days, but it's the copies that count and that's where Epson really delivers.\n",

I was thinking buying another Olympus, when I checked out the Nikon AW100. I decided to buy Nikon because it seemed a better camera than the Olympus Stylus Tough 8010 14MP Digit al Camera or Olympus ToughTG-1 iHS. In the end I am glad I bought the Nikon AW100. It has been a month now and I am glad to say I made a good choice.\n",

      "I read through all the reviews prior to picking up this knife, as I wanted to ensure I was getting the most out of my moneys worth, as well as being an avid outdoorsmen, who greatly appreciates his/her primary tool. Fortunately for me, upon my knife’s arrival, there was little for me to critique or complain about, as all the con’s that were covered from other reviewers seemed non-existent. Upon opening, the blade came very sharp, straight, much larger than expected, with the scabbarb (sheath) perfectly intact. There is plenty of reach (I’d like to reiterate \"PLENTY”) with 13” overall length and a great piercing ability from everything that I have dealt with outdoors thus far. The Pakkawood handle provides great comfort, and feels very well balanced between the blade and the entire knife.<br /><br />Overall, a very well made product and I would recommend this knife to any outdoors or even indoor individual! I will definitely be looking into other Elk Ridge products, as this has been a great buy, for such a LARGE Blade! Take advantage of this product while stocks last!!\n",

Works great and is very sturdy.<br /><br />Thank you.\n",

Separately this pump is $8  and a bag of balloons is $ 9 add in the price of a book (most are $ 10 or more) and it's a good bargain.  I have been comparing instruction videos on youtube and nothing I have found online for free comes even close to the quality of the videos that are included here.

They are very bright, in my opinion, with a good color temperature to fit my application. Moreover, they started saving money for me on electric bill from the day one. I like the \"energy saving\" idea and I am considering to replace all my incandescent light with LED. I just need to spend some time t figuring out which LED light is compatible. I accidently placed two orders and asked seller to cancel one. To my surprise, their reply e-mail showed up in my e-mail within 2 hours. Amazing service！ I'd like to keep buying from them.\n",
      "My son wanted this for his birthday and must admit I had no idea what Mine Craft was so I had to do some research on what it was and only then did I find out that this Lego set was based upon a computer game.<br /><br />His older brother played this game and so he had become familiar with it and even his older brother likes this set, even if he is too old for Lego. That said, the set is for ten plus aged children.<br /><br />My son loves this set and builds fantastic structures and in fact this set encourages children to build in their creative play and the three dimensional aspect to is wonderful.<br /><br />My only criticism with the set is that it is very small indeed and sells out very quickly, this set also became the must have set for Christmas so if you see one midyear buy it then as it will have sold out online.\n",

But after seeing these, I had to find one that didn't snag.<br /><br />This one is THE ONLY ONE that I have found in a store or online, of the faux pearl variety, without knots in between (those look less like a regular pearl necklace), that doesn't snag- yay!<br /><br />Up close you can see the metallic white swirl, but not noticeable to others and really, I'll easily take that over having my hair snagged.\n",
      "These are real handy to have for running, walking or biking.  My arms are more on the skinny side, but they stay up. I tried another brand that was just too tight and lacked air flow but this brand is perfect in every way.  I can easily stretch them up over my biceps if needed. They are pretty soft too.\n",

      "Whilst crime is not rife in my area we do have trouble with youths who hog the darkened areas of the street at night. I needed a good, bright light that would light my porch area if anyone came to close to my front door.<br />This light is ideal and with a whopping 850 lumen output it is damn bright! One ideal thing is that it is completely self-contained and does not need to wired to the mains electricity which helps. The batteries are charged up by the solar panel and a full charge will allow the light to be on continuously for 30 minutes, however, this never happens as it comes on and only stays of on for a few seconds at a time. But, importantly, the batteries will allow the light to come on for approximately 72 times for about 25 seconds each time. But, at least they will be fully charged by the next night fall.\n",

      "Sharp makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.  One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.   Additionally I found this mount to be very helpful http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00K69M0TY  The next step to take into consideration is features.

      "I searched around for a compact form solar panel with a decent watt output for my application and this works great! I have decided to begin adding some Solar Power to some minor electrical applications in my household (Battery Chargers, small power tools, etc). I assumed that this product would help me do just that... In making the decision to buy this particular panel I did hours of research and then made the purchase. The panel came packaged very nicely and in great shape\n",

      "We have a temperpedic mattress that was handed down to us and we love it. it was getting time for a new one and we realized we could never afford a temperpedic on our budget. i looked around and found this. we decided to purchase it for a guest bed to see if it was as good a value as it seemed. after it gassed out i would say it is just as good if not better than the temperpedic mattress we have had. ive slept like a baby since we switched our old mattress into the guest room and put the new one in ours. its an AMAZING value!\n",
      "These two women are extremely amazing. Natalie Portman is gorgeous, and Scarlett Johnansen is heavenly. To see them come together in a movie is just amazing. I do not know why this is only rated as a 3 star. It is a very well done film.\n",

      "Purchased this not spontaneously however its sufficiently shoddy to do as such. Did a touch of examination clearly. I've got knee ligament harm. I abhor my knee prop its so uncomfortable so I thought I'd attempt this. Clearly not as strong its not intended to be. At the same time I have perceived in the month I've been utilizing it that I'm utilizing less painkillers (something to be thankful for) and my knee is less swollen. The main issue is it peels off rapidly under trousers. I've now purchased a fixer spread so I trust it progresses. I would prescribe for anybody with comparative knee issues.\n",

This product is a definite must-have because it just offers protection from blistering and skin damage no matter how long you plan to work on any type of welding project.  Your skin will definitely remain soft and smooth even after many hours of working as long as you wear this welding armor.<br />Are you worried about the price, I can safely say that this product is extremely affordable.  Compared to other welding gloves, I found that this is one of the most affordable and if not the most affordable gloves that you can ever find in the market.\n",

Its a good all around messenger bag, it can accommodate my things the 2 additional zippered pockets are good for my small things like flash drives and coins.

I have had coffee cups with some coffee left over and still never leaked. This bag is just the right size and stays out of the way. My car has really stayed clean since I bought this bag. it is also really easy to clean.\n",
      "Came with my bed i bought as a package deal. Over all, these little guys work great and have plenty of height on them. After putting a box spring on my bed from this collection, the night stands are just shy of the height of the mattress. Lastly these night stands have led to us wanting to buy the rest of the bed room set.\n",
      "I love to send note cards for no reason, with random messages and stuff like that. Therefore, I saw these and decided to buy a set of 10 and use them. I gotta say the quality of the paper they were printed on, definitely not something you see in other common note cards, also, the printed design is beautiful and colorful. I just love them and I will make sure to buy more of these in the near future.\n",
      "We've had this for as long as we've had Gucci (our dog) so that's about more than 3 human years and it stills work well and kicks ass until now. Conclusion: It's a very sturdy and well-made leather dog leash.\n",
      "This product surpassed my expectations. It was sturdier than I expected, colorful, and had everything a very young person would need to start gardening. Of all the presents our 4 yr. old grandson received it was one of the first he used, even before some of his toys! I preferred this gardening set over others as it is heavy duty plastic instead of the tools made of metal. We felt the spade and gardening fork would be too dangerous for little ones if they were metal. The cute carrying case is a bonus. I would recommend this for 4 yrs. and up. We were very pleased!\n",
      "In all, it took about 2 minutes to figure the product out in order to mount on the bike. The rubber filling was not secured to the hinge in any way, so we almost lost it. Without it, I don't think the mount would be able to hold itself upright on the handlebars.\n",
      "This kit is amazing! My kids love it and they've tattooed themselves and started asking me as well to make one.<br /><br />I love the fact that they can express their creativity and have fun at the same time.<br /><br />It is not suited for small children as they can swallow parts. This is clearly mentioned on the pack.\n",
      "This is a great sandbox playset. I got this for my little nephew, who loves to play in the sandbox in the garden. The variety of toys in this set is providing him with great fun and he already made a lot of creations he was very proud of.<br />The quality is great, the whole set is made of plastic, but the handles of the shovels and rake aren't bending or seem unstable.<br />Overall, this is a great toy set for a good price.\n",
      "The product shipped out really quickly.Happy to see that the installation just attach to a rope and tie to a tree branch. The swing is sturdy can hold the bigger kids as well as the smaller kids. The adjustable height is perfect makes sure everyone can join on the fun.Bonus drainage hole no sitting water you have to drain out or watch for mosquitoes like the tire swings. The shape of the swing aids for great spin time\n",
      "Everything you need is here already. What a wonderful tool set and aside from being handy the quality of the product is highly recommendable.\n",
      "At $25, this is unbelievable quality.  The fabric is incredibly soft and it feels nicer to wear than anything else I own.<br /><br />The highlight though, is really the fit. It's GREAT!  I was a bit sceptical but it looks and fits exactly like the photograph.  It probably helps if you are in pretty good shape already or on the slim side.<br /><br />Postage time was ok.  It took 8 days for delivery (but still much better than Amazons estimated delivery time).  Well worth the wait!\n",
      "I'm highly recommended this is fantastic C&S Pretaped Drop Cloth 48 in x 75 ft with 18mm Blue Masking Tape.Because i'm purchased and use this for painting my home.It is Easy & Quick to apply and remove! and it's price is so much reasonable.If you don't trust so please you will purchase and use this for your home.\n",
      "This is the best water carrier I have ever seen. I have never seen a collapsible water carrier. What makes this a great product is it is easy to store when empty and it is also easy to transport if you have to. It is sturdy with great handles and easy to pack. It is great for camping and any place you go .\n",

      "This is an amazing device, i never taught of it that i could come across a very portable and handy knife sharpener like this one made from BlizeTec. My item arrived today and it was delivered in a perfect condition and as described by the seller. I got to test my device for the very first time with my blunt kitchen knife and it performed wonderfully well. It sharpened my kitchen knife excellently well and in few minutes am done with the sharpening. I realize i can use it for any of my blade-like tool at home, i tried it with the blade of my secateurs as and it sharpened it very well,i dare not scratch my hand across the blade of my knife and secateurs. Its portable and very handy, it can be taken to camping exercise and also taken along to anywhere, i realize that it can also be used for self defense in case of any attack.<br />Am really happy i got this, am happy i got a very good value for my money.<br />Excellent.\n",

      "I work from home and was looking for a chair similar to those in my office. It was quite easy to put together and this Chair looks beautiful and the color is vibrant. Love it! As for comfort, cushion is like sitting on a cloud - but with support. The back supports you well  and very nice chair overall, very pleased. I was specifically looking for a breathable mesh chair w/ lumbar support and this chair fit both well. I highly recommend.\n",

      "The package arrived on time and it had 4 bullet IP cameras, HTML cable, CD, Mouse, remote, camera cables, Ethernet cables, power cable. Once I showed my family how great this security system worked, now they want to purchase them for their homes as well. It's worth the purchase! Overall i am very satisfied with the product. Offers great quality for the price.\n",

      "Product arrived in great condition and it works as expected, also excellent customer service! I give it my 5 stars!\n",
      "I see that there is a lot of negative reviews of this item. You may not be able to use this vest for take off and landing, but during the flight it is GREAT to be able to secure your baby. Especially if you are doing a long flight and you want to sleep yourself. Then you put on the vest on your baby, and then you attach it to your belt and you know that your baby can not fall down and in case of sudden turbulence he will not fall out (or up). That's how I have been using it anyway. It feels very safe to have my baby sleep with the vest on and then attached to me. If you fly with your baby in the lap, this is the only way to be able to be a little bit \"hands free\" during the flight, and know that your baby is safe.<br /><br />So far I have never been told I can't use this item on any airline.\n",
      "From the moment we opened the box, we felt this monitor will be something different. And we weren't mistaken, the installation was automatic, all we had to do is connect the cables in the way the app told us, that's it. I love being able to move the camera right from the phone. I always have my phone on me and can peek at the baby any time I want, even when I'm away from home.\n",
      "Just watched Short Circuit again recently after many years and it is still a great movie. A bit dated here and there, but that did not stop me from enjoying it.\n",
      "Since I got this Quadcopter, recording videos have never been easier. I take this beauty out for a walk at nights and take lovely videos which I share on youtube. I got many views and I enjoy doing what I'm doing\n",
      "I bought this for my 4-month old baby and she loves it so much. Although she kept on copying the eyes of the owl and make her eyes big too. Its a little bit bothering but she looks oh so cute when she does that. I just hope her eyes won't bigger.\n",
      "he leather is soft and durable, smells like leather but not too fragrantly and seems to be of good quality. It has a main pocket, interior zippered pocket as well as slip pockets for your cell phone and keys. The handle is soft. I found it to be terrific quality and very durable. It is worth every penny I paid for it.\n",
      "Wonderful film. Inaritu has made a cinematic masterpiece. The characters are deep and the cinematography creates an intimate experience with them. I loved every minute.\n",
      "This is an awesome supplement, I can use it in so many different ways, it's unbelievable! I use it most often while driving cars, and the point of view I can catch thanks to this is stunning and breath-taking! Would buy this again for sure.\n",
      "This is a really great classic toy train set, the detail on the engine is incredible. I was really surprised by the power and speed that this has. I've played with a few in the toy store that cost more money and they all seem sluggish with mediocre sound effect and no smoke. The sound effects on this set are impressive and my son loves the smoke feature. The train set seems plenty durable but the engine has a lot of little detail pieces that could be broken easily if your child is very rough with it. My son loved the train so much that he had to sleep with the engine tonight!! :)\n",
      "These ink cartridges have saved the day. I was really paying a lot each month to print, and so much I was thinking about running to the nearest office max just to pay them to do it. However, I don't have to now. These cartridges really last a long time and print brilliant color. I am so happy I found this brand.\n",
      "This is a great product it is propeller blades and props with protection. The package includes 1 5x combo propeller blades(20pcs) , 2 propellers protection cover ONLY for Hubsan x4 H107L,  and one U Wrench. This is a great product I would buy again\n",
      "Great Tasting Stevia with no bitterness and no aftertaste. If you taste it directly, it is not very pleasant, however when added to beverages or anything else it tastes amazing! Highly recommended!!! Best Stevia Powder on the market!\n",
      "Caveat that with the fact it wouldn't jump the 15 feet from the battery to the outboard with my corroded old bilge water soaked cables, but direct to the engine it was beautiful. (Put off replacing cables... Check). Jumped the outboard 10 times in succession with no problem and it claimed it was still near full charge.\n",
      "This is one really awesome dress , it is really nice! I bought it for my girlfriend because we were going to a business meeting together and she needed some stylish to look good. The size of this dress was perfect , it looked just perfect on her. With a pair of heels this dress is amazing!\n",
      "This lanyard is a really class thing to hold your escalade keys onto. I really like it and I use it everyday for my keys. Having a cadillac, you just wanna have all the classy accessories to go with it.\n",
      "OMG! This is the olive oil of olive oils. I have never tasted anything like it. I don't know if it's that it is a single variety of olive, or very fresh according to the harvest year printed on the bottle, or just the land on which these olive trees are grown. This oil adds extraordinary flavor to anything you put it on and trust me, you're going to want to put it on everything! The website also shows the lab analysis, so it may be that it is so high in polyphenols. Love the burlap bag that it is delivered in. Will be giving these bottles as gifts. Thank you Menelaus for bringing a truly exceptional olive oil to the market.\n",
      "Very compact and light for a jump starter. I used it for charging my LG G2 and Kindle, and got pretty fast result. Highly recommend.\n",
      "I rarely purchase products from the internet, but this was a great purchase. Arrived on time, great price and works great. It doesn't irritate my dogs ears like the previous cleaner I used. I love the fact that all the ingredients are natural. I would recommend this ear cleaner to anyone who loves their dog and wants to give them the best!\n",
      "The crib was packed very well and was easy to assemble. It's beautiful when put together and although it's not adjustable, my handy hubby says he will build a box to raise the mattress until we're ready to have it down lower. Can't wait to use it!!\n",
      "The fact that I could order this device, program it for 5 minutes, stick it upside down in the sheepfold in my yard and now every time the weather sucks or my son hears a noise and tells me to go check on the lambs all I have to do is roll my eyes, pull out my iPhone and show him a LIVE VIDEO FEED of his lambs happily chewing on their grass . I can even hear them crunching on them! THAT IS AWESOME!<br /> I am going back to Amazon and ordering additional cameras.<br />NOTE though, every time you reboot your modem, you get new IP address.<br />and unless you find a way to make the address in your router to camera static. you need to check attached devices addresses, to access cam again . ALL easy.. once you learn it.<br />the wifi is just too handy.. anywhere there is power,within range of the router.. you got a remote view.\n",
      "I had a small surgery on my right arm recently, after the surgery it is a lot of pain to move the mouse or type on the keyboard. One of my friends recommended this product, it is wonderful, takes away a lot of tensions and pain from my arm and shoulder, it is a product really rotate freely and comfortable, very practical and well design.\n",
      "My niece love to play builder and I know she had flare for construction from the way she put stuffs together.I read nice reviews about the product and I decided to get her this Electric Rc Remote Control Construction Tractor from Ginzick.She love the toy to the extent that she never allow anyone come near it unless the batteries are completely drained. This is excavator is very durable and the build is very nice. What I really love about this toy is the remote control which makes it very easy to play with.<br />The price is affordable compare to other brands. I will buy another one for my nephew soon.\n",
      "A quality leather chair that doesn't have cheap plastic arms that hold the whole thing together.<br /><br />Make sure you flip the chair over and click the backrest into the \"lock\" position.<br />It requires some force to click in, but it will prevent the back cushion from folding flat while you use it.\n",
      "This was a gift, works great and he loved it! This was super easy to install and use, anyone could do it!<br /><br />Great product, I will recommend it to anyone, !!!\n",
      "I already enrolled my daughter to a ballet and tap dance class. I bought this leotard for her ballet sessions. The fabric was smooth and comfortable to wear. The size is just right for her.\n",
      "This was easy to hook up. The 3rd party software that comes from brother is not necessary and its a little annoying so I call it bloatware. Other than that, good image quality and very accurate text.\n",
      "The movie's more than cute, funny, and (at 81 minutes) brisk enough to move families in and out of the multiplex in mass quantities, like the social insects we are.\n",
      "These are perhaps the softest robes I have ever purchased. I bought two because of the low cost and intended to hang them in our guest bathroom for the convenience of our special guest... but now that they have arrived, I am seriously considering buying another for myself!\n",
      "I purchased the nU Groove Sharpener last week from the company website and sat down to regroove my Titleist Vokey Spin MIlled wedges. I have had the wedges since 2009 and was deciding between buying new SM4s or trying the nU Groove Sharpener to restore the grooves. Spending over $300 to replace 3 of my wedges or $13 and minimal effort on my part, it was a no brainer.  After following the instructions provided and watching the video on their website, my vokeys' grooves are back to like new. Overall, it took about 20 minutes to do the 3 wedges. The nU Groove Sharpener was easy to use and will be a great addition in my bag for cleaning the grooves on the course.\n",
      "Got  it for cleaning out my cars. However I now use it frequently to vacuum my patio instead of sweeping. My only complaint with the shop vac is the short cord. An extension cord works fine. But it'd be a nice touch.\n",
      "Love the changeable tones, and the simplicity. Plenty of distance in a basement apartment. I bought this for my friends downstairs and I liked it so much I bought one for myself !\n",
      "This is a really good olive oil. It's one of the best olive oils I have ever tried, and if you are somebody who appreciates a good one, this is it.\n",
      "I was not sure if this vest was going to be worth it. I absolutely love it now. If you are on the edge about buying it, I recommend it.\n",
      "I saw this cd case and I immediately like it. The packaging is great with more pockets on it.  Its great for road trips just listening to music.  It can hold a lot of cds like my kids' dvds so its a great for travel.\n",
      "If you get the wrong size the company is very reasonable and helps you out! They come small so get a size larger than normally would. Other than that the company is great!\n",
      "I love this rug. Bought 1 for in our playroom and 1 for in our office. It is nice thick shag and doesn't shed at all. Rolled out perfectly. I don't even have a rug pad under them and they are more than soft to walk on. Highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good rug without breaking the bank.\n",
      "Amazing series, I really loved it. If you enjoyed the series you will totally want this set. I guarantee it!\n",
      "I was a Morrowind addict throughout all of high school and college. I skipped Oblivion but jumped back in for Skyrim. But will never loose my love for that original immersal into the elder scroll series. When this came out I had to by it up. Not only for the non-Steam gameplay but also for all the nostalgia that I have missed over the years. A raised glass to those resourceful soles that are trying to bring Vardenfel back to Skyrim.\n",
      "Great price ($5.00 less than at the sporting goods store) on goggles that work well and are comfortable to wear.\n",
      "They ride up a little on the legs but so far there's been no thong problems. Im not sure of the inseam length but they do seem a little longer than past boxer briefs. I bought them for my bf and hes constantly skating, so lots of squating, jumping, running and falling and his bootys not the smallest...so far so good. Before he would always complain about undies riding up no matter how loose they seem, these seem to do their job well. Nope, they feel fit and comfortable!\n",
      "with most of the games that are coming out this year are about war games, like call of duty and modern warfer three, this one is old but in it's time it was a pretty good game and was one of the best, now with black ops two is different.<br /><br />pretty much the gun will help you get more kills and have a faster reaction that you certainly don't have with the controller, for example when you are walking with the analog stick and you have to run faster you use your thump, and if someone comes out out of nowhere or if it's hiding you can't kill him, you saw it but didn't even get a change to shoot, well with this gun it has allowed me to do all that stuff i couldn't do, even though you're a good player you can't sometimes kill everyone.<br /><br />since the Wii came out, xbox and ps3 started making the same thing pretty much, and now no body wants the Wii anymore, the gun is in a pretty good design and is really comfortable. i love it and is easy to use it.\n",
      "Its nice to wear. Everytime I wear this I got lots of compliments from other people and most of all from my friends.They like it too.\n",
      "It's very bright and colorful and offers many different effect. All in all this light is good value for money compared to prices I have seen for similar lights in local stores.\n",
      "I got this product for my 6 month old nephew. He gets sick a lot and my sister (his mom) was having a lot of trouble using the basic blue bulb snot sucker. This one works so much better! You can control the amount of suction and it really helped my nephew be able to breathe through his nose. I will definitely recommend this product.\n",
      "Bought this knife as a Father's Day gift for my dad who is an ex-Marine.  He LOVED it!  It came razor sharp out of the box and is a nice addition to his extensive knife collection.  At this price you can't beat the value.  This item is more of a true collector's item than a practical every day carry.  Highly recommend!\n",
      "The quality id really good. It is very nice and they help with the positions that we have to get to with my wife very well\n",
      "Rather than wall towel bars, I purchased this free-standing pedestal towel tree. It does not take up much room and holds 3 towels. I am using this towel tree in our master bathroom. It meets my needs and looks very nice.\n",
      "This fly swatter is amazing. I think it is the thickets fly swatter that I've ever own. It is very thick but yet does bend. It is pretty heavy and doesn't take much force to kill a fly. The swatter part is very good size. It also has a nice rubber  grip on it.\n",
      "My Doctor have one of this at his office. He only used these once on me to check my skin because I was somehow developing a sudden skin disease that was very unexpected and my wife would always cry like what if I die. I waa very curious as to knowing this Microscope  Endoscope capabilities and they looked pretty sharp. I was asking questions and he was answering and wanted to know why did I developed a new found interest for these and I told him because I thought that they're pretty cool.\n",
      "This bag is just the perfect fit for my camera and the pockets are just exact for my memory cards and battery. It's very light and looks great. I also really like the padding considering I accidentally let go of it twice and everything still works perfectly.\n",
      "My new pet fate is awesome, I love that the gate allows for easy access to enter in and out of closed areas. the height is wonderful I have dogs that can jump 6 feet by breed and that extra height gives me that added security that they are safe. I use my gate for me porch /deck so this gives the dogs the freedom to go out the door and run around , not allowing them to go down the stairs,but also visitors can enter using the open walk through.truely an awesome gate. love it. its steel structure , provide wear in our rainy seasons.\n",
      "This 18.5 inch monitor for a fantastic price, and all things considered this monitor does its job and it works. i can use this my office for CCTV. this was easy to install. excellent picture quality. really sharp colors. honestly speaking this was very nice and excellent quality with reasonable price. I'm happy with this purchase so i would highly recommended this Security Monitor.\n",

      "I rarely use this neck pillow but when I fly it has to be with me. GIves support and makes sleeping possible...and not on your neighbor.\n",
      "They feel silky and soft on the legs and they were fairly comfortable. Goes very nicely with formal wear. They gave a little warmth too for the evening function I wore them to. The price was reasonable for the quality as well.\n",
      "Even after being a fan of this product for a while, I still can wrap my head around the contradiction of the packaging and the product itself. The packaging is just so unappetizing and yet the pancakes I make are so delicious every time!\n",
      "Although this hitch cap is inexpensive, it is well made. It fit perfectly. It has a snug fit, but is easy to remove too. It gives the hitch a more polished look when not in use. Worth the extra couple of bucks.\n",

      "From the time I was 14 until I turned 50 in 2000, I was a dedicated \"film\" camera nut. In 1990, I graduated to a serious Nikon film camera and two quality lenses, a standard zoom and a telephoto zoom. Reluctantly, as the digital chatter started to fill most camera club discussions and magazines, I started to experiment with two advanced digital point-and-shoot cameras with a minimum of 10X optical zooms... each for a period of 4 years. The die was cast at that point, and I sadly found a storage spot for my beloved film gear. The second of the point-and-shoots was the Canon PowerShot S5 IS with the articulating LCD screen. I cannot begin to tell you the value of an articulating digital LCD screen that allows you to capture an eye level image of a blossom without the need to sit on the ground to do so. Or, capture several hours worth of a full lunar eclipse with a tripod mounted camera at a nearly overhead celestial body. That tilted screen made the job easier and saved lots of neck pain. So, from 2009 through the end of January (2011), I labored over which DSLR/lens combinations would take my \"mad money\". Being a Nikon man carried the ball, but I wanted that articulating LCD screen. Like buying a car, sometimes the little things carry the day.<br /><br />On February 1, 2011, I became the proud owner of a Canon DSLR. I purchased the Canon 60D body and two Canon \"L\" lenses: the f4 24-105mm IS USM standard zoom and the f2.8L 70-200mm IS II USM telephoto zoom. Sure, the camera body was significant, but lens quality takes your images to the NEXT level. I was confident with the decision, and now after a month of serious practice with the 60D/lens combinations, I am getting VERY satisfying image quality...sharp or soft depending on the subject. Not only does the camera body have the necessary articulating LCD screen, it allows me as much control as I choose...from full auto to standard settings, to the zone where I live...aperature-priority and shutter-priority. Living along the Atlantic Flyway, February can be a challenging month weather-wise but the Canon 60D and the lenses proved to be up to the task, especially when the first and last hours of light give you some truly spectacular wildlife opportunities and remarkable sunrises and sunsets.<br /><br />Just know that I don't spend my money recklessly and I expect results when I put my money down. Without a doubt, this camera body passed the February test in all kinds of lighting and temperatures ranging from 15 degrees to 65 degrees. I did little here to address the 60D's specs, but I now know this camera is not a Rebel and it's not a 7D. The controls and advanced features truly put the 60D in its own niche. If you want the specs, check the review by dojoklo dated Sept. 20, 2010.<br /><br />Bottom line: This camera is a good fit for a sports enthusiast, a dedicated nature/landscape lover, and the individual with a vision of digitally capturing \"gallery\" quality images. You are IN CONTROL with the 60D in your hands.\n",

      "Was interested in the new Smart Bulbs after reading about them, I was ready to spend $200 when I found these bulbs on browsing through Amazon. The reviews were quite good and said they would be able to do the same as the Hue for 1/10 the price, I must admit I was a bit skeptical but figured for the price I could give them a try (and at worse purchase the Hue if they broke).<br />I can say the colors are very bright. The controller is simple and easy to use to change colors. They are great for party or evening dinner to dim the light or change the setting. The one thing I may say- the white light in these bulbs is a bit blue in color, so you may need to keep your normal white lights.<br />But for money, I am very happy w/ my buy- they do everything that is described. I have had these for 3 months now and still no problems. Thank you Torchstar!!!!<br />Many people reviewing mentioned articles in the New York Times and USA Today, so I decided to use google to take a look. My cousin had purchased similar bulbs and they were very cool. They changed the mood of karaoke party. For the price, I decided to try them and figure at worse I had wasted $20 to try a smart bulb. I have used these for 2 months and can share the following:<br />The bulb colors are very bright, particularly the blue color makes a cool mood. When turning off the bulb, it remembers the previous color setting, very smart. The remote is easy to use and all the functions work properly (considering the price I wasn't sure). My favorite feature is mixing colors- always love playing with it to create a new mood. The only thing I may say is these bulbs are more of a toy than a regular light.\n",

The elastic strap works well enough for me and it doesn't seem to slide around much so I'm happy. The only thing that I feel I should note is that you DEFINITELY have to unplug the cushion when it's not in use so that you don't run down your battery. Other than that, it's pretty easy to get the hang of and awesome to have every winter!\n",

So i was worried if mimogram would be the same as the other ones i've purchased. But guess what, they are not!! My mimogram cloths still look like new!

My hubby Dub gets his Canon 7D with a 24-105 on it in the main pouch, a Speedlite flash in one side pouch,  a 17-40 wide angle in the other side and a diffuser and extra batteries in the front pouch so he's good to go for just about any situation.\n",

Skylink offers more quality and features, the system and sensors were very easy to set-up. Within minutes I was in the testing mode. As for the Fortress system, ughh unnecessary headache! 2 hours later the system was still not communicating properly.

      "I keep cleaning my terrarium.  I always use this sand, I still have a lot of this left. Truly a great deal. You get so much product to the price.\n",
      "These are good quality, well-priced and arrived quickly. They are so true to the picture. They fit nicely, block the sun and even come in nice packaging.\n",
      "Awesome grilling tools for the spit. Well designed for comfort and long enough to minimize contact with high heat. Very strongly made for heavy pieces of meat but also look very nice. Engineered to do their job easily. I like the padded handles also. I definitely think they have a great price for what you get. I recommend them. Very nice.\n",
      "I purchased these to keep my exploring 18 month old twins out of our entertainment center.  My friend has one of these: http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B007A2ZSZ8/  We have two glass doors they just loved to open. Applying them was easy, but unfortunately one of my girls tugged on the strap before it was really set and ripped the back latch (the one we don't use) off the wood. It wouldn't stick now so I just pulled out some of my extra command strips and stuck it down. It's mostly out of sight so we don't see the tabs and it works great! The locks are pretty large and unsightly, but they get the job done and they can't figure it out (yet). I'm sure by 3 or so they'll discover they just have to push the buttons and boom! Access to whatever. But they are excellent for now.  It would be nice if they supplied extra adhesive just in case (or for reuse). It'd also be nice if they made them in a black, and a brushed and polished silver color too, just to make them look slightly nicer.  They accomplish what I wanted at an excellent price, would recommend!  Edit: September 7, 2013:  My daughters are now over two years old and still cannot get into these. I put them on all cabinets in our kitchen now as well. If I leave one off on accident they try to put it back on but can't. They have very small hand and not much strength in them so I have confidence that these will last for a long time.   You really have to push the side buttons and pull it off, my daughters can't do this. To apply the ones in my kitchen I removed the adhesive provided on the lock all together and stuck it on with command strips instead to save the cabinets in our rental house. My daughters pull and pull on them and even using command strips instead of the provided adhesive they haven't been able to pull them off. Still love them!  I hope this review was helpful!\n",
      "Fit well and the fabric is nice quality!!This is the sexiest piece of lingerie I own. I'm very pleased.\n",
      "This trimmer works great and I really amazed with its performance. So fast and very easy to use string trimmer. Quality is very good for its price.\n",
      "I was a bit suspicious in the beginning as to how you could learn so many negotiation tricks in such a short time considering that negotiation skills are usually taught in 2 or 3 day seminars. I have already been to a few such seminars, and of course, a DVD cannot fully replace such a course. On the other hand, if you consider how much of those multi-day seminars I actually apply to my current job right now, the list would certainly be longer for the DVD than for the seminars. I think this is because the negotiation tips on the DVD are very clear and simple. I can easily remember many of the examples and use/adapt them during my own negotiations.<br /><br />The description of the DVD is actually very acurate: A lot of good negotiation tricks in a simple format without much theory of fancy graphics. Instead, everything is explained via examples focussing on how you can reapply them to your situation as fast as possible. So, if you are like me and like this approach, this DVD is perfect for you. If you prefer learning via theory and methods, you are likely better off buying one of the many detailed books available on the market. Or you do both.\n",
      "I have a 2008 Miata, and those Mazda folks, they make a zippy little roadster, but the stock windscreen just doesn't cut it. I got this deflector because it works along with the stock windscreen. I'd stay it increases blockage by 3X. That is, when I'm driving at 20 MPH with just the stock windscreen, it feels like I'm driving at 60 MPH with this windscreen in place. So this deflector certainly does an effective job and makes driving top-down in my little Miata much better. Shipping was fast and securely packaged, so overall good job.\n",
      "OMG I love this towel sooo much! I use it every time I work out! It works great and cools me right down! I definitely recommend it to anyone who works out or likes to be cool!!\n",
      "It's perfect for me till now, cool to use while having 2nd hand busy to take something or more, and not feeling like -Can't do nothing- while recording, plus not moving or focus losing.\n",
      "The major thing I've found with nextgen cartridges toners are they're consistently good in quality and capacity. I've used them for almost 2 years, through several printers, and never had any problems. It helps me save money each time I purchase. I recommend these to any small business owners.\n",

      "This screen shelter saved my life! Well, actually it just kept out some incredibly annoying bugs but if you had seen those bugs, you would be exaggerating too. Anyway, the bottom line is that this shelter was effective and more so.\n",
      "The sharpener is really nice. The package itself is already something you will be able to appreciate from the very start. It comes with extra blades and very nice finger grips. It sharpens pencils so fast because its electric. Can't get any better than that. Definitely 5 stars!\n",
      "Bought this for my son.He's certainly enjoying these lenses very much.Coated lenses, nicely finishes aluminum housing, easy to us.The magnetic rings stick on the phone firmly.Easy and light to carry around.Good value for money\n",
      "The clip is easy to use and scratch resistant when it is fitted over your glasses (especially perscription ones).\n",
      "Love this bag! It's very comfortable to wear as a messenger-style bag, and fits all of my photo gear!\n",
      "Very strong bags they tend not to rip as easier as other bags out there, I'm very happy with the texture of the bags and I think I can confidently carry these bags with my dog to the park and not have to worry about the bag going on me its not extremely thin plastic and that leaves me in the green.\n",
      "Amazing!! High quality! I am very happy. The size fits me well and I feel comfortable. It is perfect! I like it very much. My friend also said it is very very good.\n",
      "Just so serene and elegant. Makes me feel so relaxed.... I love this video.  I highly recommend it.  It is just perfect.\n",
      "This toner lasted longer and worked better than the original one. The original had deep colors but also ran out too quickly. Great for the price for a laser printer toner.\n",
      "Well designed gift basket. All items were as described and we are pretty pleased with it. Every item was of very high quality. Was a good buy indeed.\n",

      "This is a pretty good little tape dispenser. It's small, easy to fill with tape, and weighted just right. My only problem is that it fell and the metal serrated tab fell out. It took a bit to get it back on. It still works, but beware of dropping it.\n",
      "I got 2 of these, I use them for my house keys, when I go out to run they are very light weight because you can only use the small part of it and then I strap them to the rest of it so I don't loose my keys.\n",
      "very nice bag at a nice price. has a nice shape that lends itself to some creative packing. lots of take homes.\n",
      "These are relatively small sized diamond bits. I use them to drill holes in glass for making lamps out of wine bottles. They work just fine and I am very satisfied with their performance. The trick is to keep them wet, and figure you are going to get a little messy using them. You may want to experiment with them to get the hang of it. Keeping the bit on position can be tough when you first start.\n",
      "Received mine 2 days ago, design, ease of use and cleaning excellent. More importantly as an avid drinker of H20, this takes it to new heights. Knowing I am doing something very healthy for my body using natural ingredients as well as hydrating. I am so impressed with this infuser that I just ordered another for a friend\n",
      "I see the bad reviews, but I do not understand why. Because the one I bought was so great.! Worked really well!\n"
