This is a web app made for the online consumers. We all know about the internet shopping frauds that happen today. People in order to sell their product buy people to give good reviews as well as to defame others. To save consumers from all this, the app provides an interface wherein you can give the url of the product you are thinking of buying. The app then, after processing it tells you whether you shoud buy it or not. The implementation is based on the combination of two processes, i.e. fake review detection and sentiment analysis. Firstly, the app scrapes the reviews from the product page and then detects the fake reviews and then on the real reviews it performs sentiment analysis to tell whether to buy the product or not. The Fake Review models firstly has a text feature detector, the output of which is then passed on to a svm classifier. The sentiment analysis model is based on a bag of words and ngram approach. The feature classifier is a 1D conv net. If LSTM or GRU is used , the results will be better.
